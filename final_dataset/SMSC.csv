We may have collectively driven up enough sentiment in wall street to make other big players go long on GME with us (we do not have the money to move the stock as much as it did alone). we didn‚Äôt hurt wall street as a whole, just a few funds went down while others went up and profited off the shorts the same as us.

SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE,"Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

THIS IS THE MOMENT,"Life isn't fair. My mother always told me that when I would complain about arbitrary treatment. I would play by the rules and someone else would ignore them. When they would win I would appeal to the first authority for an explanation. ""Are you going to let them get away with this""? ""Life isn't fair"". No, it is not. The game is the game. Always.

In this moment, the fascade cracks further. When the first breach was made I do not know, perhaps it was Socrates, but today I see thousands. Millions. 

Once they were laughing, luxuries falling out of their disgusting diseased mouths as they cackled. The unmistakable stench of derision carried on their breath. They told anyone outside of their elite class that we were fools for even trying. They told us that we were naive. We needed networks to be successful. We needed polish. We needed expertise. We needed THEM. The game is the game. Always. 

They are no longer laughing. Their odious oeuvre still wafts through the air. While the rot, and hate, and condescention, remains, the noxious air betrays a new addition. Something all together disconcerting. What it betrays, is fear. They are afraid. And they should be. We do not need their inherited resources masked as acumen. A new day dawns. The day where we make an ever so slight step towards what they fear the most. An even field. Life becoming ever so slighty more fair.   AND. THEY. ARE. SCARED. They look at us and see roughness. We look at them and see softness. We are both correct in our estimation.

The game is the game. Always.

"We need to keep this movement going, we all can make history!"," I believe right now is one of those rare opportunities that we all can help and do good. Some of these companies like GME, AMC are good companies that's been hit hard by this pandemic. Hedgefunds and Wallstreet just want to short these companies to zero and make millions. 

 I really think right now we have enough support and enough of us to change that direction in history. Wallstreet says  well weak companies need to just go. 10 yrs down the road though I want to be able to watch a movie in a movie theater with my family. If we all buy and hold in what we believe in it gives these companies a second chance and we as a group can stop these companies from being shorted to death and just disappear.

"Once you're done with GME - $AG and $SLV, the gentleman's short squeeze, driven by macro fundamentals","You guys are champs. GME... who would have thought a bunch of crazy retards could reach the front page of the New York Times.

And when you're done with GME, it's time to punish the big banks who have been suppressing the price of silver since the Bear Stearns / JPM merge. It's all in fucking Bloomberg:

You think GME squeezed hard? Look what happened to silver half a year ago in July:

That's one of the banks getting squeezed out of silver, having to cover their shorts... and that's just because rich boomers freaked out about financial instability and finally started calling out the Comex on their bullshit, and taking physically delivery of silver... which they don't have.

Now imagine 4 million degenerates buying $SLV, forcing the trust to take delivery of physical silver from the Comex. This isn't GME, who's fair price is maybe around $5 a share. The FAIR price of silver based on the historical gold/silver ratio is almost surely over $50/ounce. This short squeeze will be a fantastic success even if we can take silver to it's fair market value.

And then there's $AG. Because once silver starts moving, $AG is going to go to the fucking moon. 1) it's a leverage play on silver, 2) It's got it's OWN SHORTS TO BE SQUEEZED OUT. At least a 23% short float as of last count: [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm)

I'm so proud of how far this subreddit has come,"I still remember when I first joined and most people here were going all in on binary options trades on things like trial results being positive or negative from a pharmaceutical company. Back when penny stocks weren't against the rules, the days of delisted tickers like OMVS and the others. I know a lot of you (about 2 million in the past couple of days) are new here, but I just wanted to say this has been one hell of a journey over the years with you guys.

I joined WSB back when I was still in highschool. I feel like I've grown up with you guys. I still remember losing $2000 on my 21st birthday when one of these biopharm companies we were all playing released their trial phase results. That was a lot of money to me then, still is to be honest, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a hell of a time and learn a lot of valuable information in losing that couple thousand dollars. I still remember how happy I was when i logged in one day to see i had finally earned a flair in my favorite subreddit as well.

It's 5 am here and I'm kind of cooked right now off the sauce, so I'm probably rambling at this point, but I just wanted you to know that I love you all and you're all some very unique people. Being here in this sub is proof enough of that to me. I hope you are all blessed with as many tendies as you can eat.

My brokerage wants to force close my GME calls,"My brokerage called me and asked me to close my 115 calls expiring this friday. If I wouldn't close them at todays market open, they'd do it, and they'd do it for all customers with GME options expiring this friday. I could open a position expiring next week if I wanted to.

&#x200B;

Their reasoning was that I didn't have enough cash to exercise the calls and they don't know if trading of GME will be halted for some time in the next few days. Therefore my calls would get exercised with my balance in the negative.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm fine with closing the position and rolling it out to next week and a higher strike, since I also have a ton of shares. But this still sounds fishy to me, like they wanted to minimize the amount of shares they'd have to buy to hedge for another gamma squeeze. They told me I ""also had other positions that were heavily covered in the media, but those were fine, GME realls is a big exception right now""

Iacta alea est,"I was the lucky one in my family.  In 2008 I was in the middle of my first enlistment.  My college had been taken care of beforehand, because I'd been accepted into a program at UMass Boston for high school students with above-average grades.  A week after graduating high school I received a degree in psychology and went off to be a Marine.

I remember 2008.  I remember my father's savings being nuked, his portfolio going to zero.  Twenty years in the United States Navy and he'd had his savings completely obliterated because of the collapse that Wall Street caused.  I remember my mother calling me in the middle of the night--I was in Okinawa, Japan at the time--and crying because the savings were gone.  That day I started sending a measly $1,000 a month to my family to take care of bills and keep my siblings fed.  My grandmother's retirement was gone in the blink of an eye but she survived, because she loved her job (she was still working in her 60s at a retirement home).  But she had to get a reverse mortgage to keep the house.  I didn't have to send money too long--only about five months--until my father got a better job, and my mother was able to get her own job as well.  But I remember the desperation in her voice.

I'm 34 now.  I've done my time in the military.  No pension, I didn't serve long enough.  But now I can look at this entire debacle and fucking laugh.  I'm a capitalist at heart.  I support being paid for your services.  But I remember the bullshit you engaged in, and I know many others do as well.  Occupy Wall Street did fuck all to you.  But now the internet has given way to arguably the worst thing for you: actual communication and planning.  Now you're seeing what a group of people who loathe everything you stand for can do to you in days.  You won't learn from it, though, which is okay.  This may not keep happening, but every time you decide to attempt something like this the fear will be there, in the back of your mind.  I wish I could have gotten in on this.  I'm not able to spend money like many of these people can.  But I hope it hurts, and it seems like it is.

And there should be no mercy in a situation like this.  Hound them until they concede.

There is an alternative to this system,"How fucking stupid is it that retail gets no chance to participate in any stage of an ipo - I‚Äôve always thought how incredibly fucked up is it that hundreds of people who have literally nothing to do with the formation or creation of a company are buying a pre-ipo at $10 then selling it to millions of retail at $100 only to watch it crash back to $5. We sit there terrified hoping the big guys throw us a bone. For those of us here at WSB the last 5 years this leads to massive disillusionment. And it‚Äôs all fun and games because everyone on the inside wins. How stupid is it that there is no transparency to the underpinnings of valuation and that there is 0 regulation of shorting a company and fucking it‚Äôs employees beyond 100% float just to control the asset?

As you're all aware, Point72(along with citadel) injected \~2.7B into Melvin.  The reason why I bring this up is because Point72's owner, Steven Cohen formerly ran SAC capital. Point72 is a family office, SAC was a hf. Cohen and friends got into shit for insider trading along with paying off research firms to get access to information before anyone else to be the first to profit. They engaged in frequent insider trading which they referred to as black edge and emailed trade ideas with a scale of conviction to show their confidence in the trade. By emailing their trade ideas with a conviction rating and not specifying their source protected Cohen from getting in trouble.  

At the end of all of this, some traders pleaded guilty but Martoma(who served jail time) was Cohen's super bitch because he didn't want Cohen to get caught. Cohen closed SAC and made point72 which happens to be performing outstanding well. He paid a $1.8B penalty. Digging a bit [deeper](https://files.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/content/viewform/adv102012/Sections/iapd_AdvDrpSection.aspx?ORG_PK=161111&FLNG_PK=02571B2200080189034C92F10037612D056C8CC0), you can see that Cohen has been using material non-public information since 1999. That report shows what they have been caught doing. Imagine all the shit that they got away with. 

Hedge funds have always been doing shady shit and when they get caught, some of them just change their names. Ex. Och-Zif --> Sculptor capital management.

If what is written in this article is true, the ""technical difficulties"" that some brokerages were stating yesterday evening are questionable. Maybe someone should read the terms of agreement of TD their TD Ameritrade account and comment if they are allowed to do this. Maybe some SEC rule aplies instead, I am not familiar with this yet.

A Question for today when markets are open:

\- Who is experiencing trading restrictions?

And for the whole community?

\- Are there alternatives?

So shorting well more of stock float, maybe even naked if done so, is ok for institutions, but buying a lot of stock in a collective is not ok. All of this while brokers usually make a lot of money from retail investors trading risky options / derivates, which also result in individuals losing it all.

"For those hating on RH for the last minute change, they may have just saved you...","Fucking forgot to include a God damn TL;DR

TL;DR - If robinhood didn't change the rules to spread out the sales of all your ITM contracts you fuckers can't afford to exercise, they would have sold them all at 3;00pm Friday. The market makers would be the only buyers, they sell the shares they were holding to hedge the contracts they sold, they sell all of them at once, large push down then paper hands then stop losses and flash crash.

**BONUS MATERIAL AT THE BOTTOM OF POST.**

\------- now to the real shit.

First off, not a bear or bull, I have GME and will add later yadda yadda. I'm just pointing out an observation.

Second off, this is just a theory. No fucking way I know if this is true. It's gonna sound scary, sure, but I want some genius fucker hedge manager who is pro-GME to tell me how horribly wrong I am.

Robinhood changed the rules and you can't buy any 1DTE or 0DTE positions on GME for 1/29. Ya'll got the memo. That sucks because we ALL know you guys were going to hold on to your positions for EVERY LAST OUNCE OF ROCKET FUEL. (I don't do emojis, sorry.) Robinhood may have just saved you by not letting you.

Most of you fuckers who have options have 100c, 150c, 200c whatever. You know you need money to exercise that - at a cost of $20,000 to exercise for one contract is a little more than most can handle, especially the newbies here.

Under normal circumstances, robinhood would sell your position on Friday back to market at about 3:00pm give or take 5 minutes. The problem is that I've seen the order sheets... It's you lot that owns most of the 1/29 call positions (tiny order sizes... 1 to 5 contracts.) That means most of you won't be able to exercise your position and that means it has to go to market ALL AT ONCE. (Again, this is under normal circumstances.)

What happens when you sell a bunch of contracts at bid to the market? The bid goes down, quite possibly below intrinsic value, the market makers buy it, especially in the last hour of the day, and they do the opposite of what they did last week.

They sell shares against the lower delta. If they are the ones that buy their own contracts back especially if below intrinsic, they sell however many shares the delta was for that contract. They don't want to hold on to those shares if they don't have to. That's not their game.

But they're not just selling for the 350c that's ITM while the underlying is $360. They're selling for the 220c they got at the same time. The 200c they also got. They don't need those covered anymore. So they sell on those as well. The more they sell, the more contracts start becoming OTM and the more they can sell against the lower delta those just became.

If you flush the market with contracts where there is essentially only one buyer - MMs - this kind of thing can happen and you can end up with a potential gamma flush. Opposite of a squeeze. Queue in paper hands and stop losses and you have a very nasty flash crash.

In essence, if Robinhood does NOT do the 3:00pm flush of contracts and instead actually spreads the sales out over the next 2 days, then they saved what could have been a potential flash crash wiping everyone out.

Good luck out there, be safe, make some fucking money, and imagine there are some damn rocket emoji everywhere.

Dillard's the short play no one is talking about,"Dillard's has been quietly gaining attention thanks to many articles spouting its short interest. Articles below:

https://www.barrons.com/articles/another-gamestop-here-are-the-next-10-most-shorted-small-caps-51611688092

Dillard's is currently sitting at a short percent of float of 146.36% and will be substantially higher after todays price action.

https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/DDS/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/Dillard

Dillard's $DDS share float is only 4.24 million or 19.26%. What this means is every dollar thrown at Dillard's will affect its price 5x more then a stock with a 100% outstanding float.

The lower the float the easier it is to moon.

Look at this mornings price action. DDS ran 20% to $128 on 240k of volume before being halted and shorted back down. If this stock gets any attention it will run faster than my dad from his parental duties.

Look at the after hours activity. It ran from $82-$93 on 400 shares. That's the type of moon possibility we are dealing with. Any volume premarket can send this up 50%+.

The Total Short Value Could be Underreported - Fines for Underreporting are a fucking joke,"During my research on short interest and stats on short history (for my previous TA I did on GME and posted) I came across a release from FINRA.

ORTEX showed a 6mil decrease in estimated SI from 72mil on 26th Jan to 66 mil on 27th Jan.

Thx to that guy who said that we can bypass paywall with incognito.

This gave us over 100% (150 per share) in gains. (Using after hours close to be conversative)

To hit 1k, assuming linear increase of share price to decrease in short interest, we only need 30mil shares to be covered, less than half of the current estimated short interest.

If we go by percentage increase, we barely need 15mil shares covered to blow past 1k (230% increase)

Here's the kicker, this shit isn't linear.

On the side of the prolapsed buttholes, panic increases as the price increases, even if the shorts try to diamond hand, they will get margin called.

On the side of us rocket bois, paper hands get shaken off and only the true diamond hands will remain, representing increased reluctance to part with shares.

Other than a few dumb idiots, no politician worth their salt would publicly do anything to stop GME. The backlash from the public would be MASSIVE.

PT calculation for GME

All 3 are from premarket from a 3 minute candle setup. Times for each candle are 9:15, 9:18, 9:27. Why these candles? They are completely green with no wicks.

9:15 Low 248 High 268 Volume 336k Price Range is 20$ 1$ per 16.8k Volume

9:18 Low 267.77 High 327 Volume 948k Price Range is 60$ 1$ per 15.8k Volume

9:27 Low 324 High 354.8 Volume 564k Price Range is 30$ 1$ per 18.8k Volume

My reasons for using these candles is because there was no resistance on em when I was watching, they just went up indicating institutional buying. Assuming I am correct we have 1$ move per average 17.13k Volume. We have ~70M shares shorted on GME, which accounts to ~4k$ price move. We are currently trading at 330$. If they outright cover all the shares, which they won't we will arrive at a PT of 4.3k$ for 0 Short Interest on GME. This PT also doesn't include the gamma squeezes from MM, and the bullish buying from investors. So I would say the most conservative PT for GME would be the most unlikely scenario which is 4.3k$ if the shorts just cover the entire SI. Otherwise this can keep going higher for completely different reasons as I mentioned.

NOK IS NOT GOING TO MAKE YOU MONEY,"To all the new users browsing this sub, I know NOK may look like the easy investment out of all the meme stocks being talked about right now. After all, it‚Äôs only $6 while GME is $300+, so it might moon just like GME did right!?!

WRONG. There‚Äôs more to stocks than just its price. Let me teach you something about outstanding shares and market cap.

Market cap = total shares x stock price

Right now the market cap of NOK is 37 billion while GME is 24.24 billion. This makes NOK have GREATER value than GME, NOT less.

In other words, GME IS CHEAPER THAN NOK.

For NOK to jump to $100 a share, that would mean it‚Äôs market cap increases by a bit more than 15 times, making it worth 555 BILLION. If it matches GME‚Äôs $300 price, that would make it worth over $1 TRILLION. To put things into perspective, if GME was worth $1 trillion, its stock price would be over $13,000!

The main takeaway is: STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO THE PRICE OF THE STOCK. IT DOESN‚ÄôT MEAN ANYTHING.

The more outstanding shares there are also means the harder it is to move the stock. There‚Äôs WAY more NOK shares out there than GME, so good luck getting that to go anywhere.

Finally, GME is the only stock being shorted as heavily as it is. If you don‚Äôt know what this means, just know that it means it has more moon potential.

tl;dr: NOK is a distraction. It‚Äôs not going to $100. There‚Äôs more to a stock than its price. Learn something called ‚Äúmarket cap‚Äù and ‚Äúshares outstanding.‚Äù Load up on GME. See you at $10,000 üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

EDIT: Buying NOK cause it‚Äôs cheap and you think it‚Äôll get you more gains than GME is like bringing a bus to the Daytona 500 and thinking you‚Äôll finish first cause you have the biggest engine

EDIT 2: I‚Äôm not bringing up valuations cause I think valuations mean shit in this market. They don‚Äôt. Anyone with half a brain cell can see that.

I‚Äôm bringing it up to SHOW people the relative value of NOK compared to GME so that they don‚Äôt think ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs so high already, it‚Äôs not gonna go any higher. NOK is low though so it must!!‚Äù

This is not even to mention the fact that the more overvalued you are, the harder it is to increase your overall value.

As long as we keep buying and üíéüëê the shorts will have to close, and we'll all be rich while simultaneously punishing the excessively greedy. 

However, there are very few gaurantees in life and I've yet to see a post to discuss ways we could all possibly get blindsided and left holding bags while waiting for the shorts to close. 

This is probably not an exhaustive list and I am in no way an expert (definitely an idiot). It's merely meant to get us thinking and ancipating our reaction if there's evidence that any of these or other risks is likely to happen. Basically I want the actually smart people to come in an explain why I'm wrong and/or add more risks not in this list. 

1. The SEC determines GME etc. are too big of a risk and suspends trading for 10 days.

What would the reaction be from the hedges that are short and retail investors? Would they still be able to close somehow during that period? Would it fuel the rebellion even more and drive the price even higher when trading resumes? 


2. The Hedge Funds, media, etc. scare tactics and lies work, trigging a waterfall of paper hands selling. 

There is a ton of misinformation being intentionally circulated right now and we are vulnerable because of it. Stuff like ""Melvin has already closed, has to close completely by Friday, the open short % is a lot smaller than we think, bots are trying to distract us from GME, etc."" The question is, what signs should we look for that sentiment is changing and hands are getting weaker in case some of their tactics stick? 


3. Melvin has already started to close under our noses.

Is this even possible? Many sources seems to indicate the short percentage has barely changed and that their statment about ""repositioning"" to close GME is complete BS. The volume and price action trends seem to show that is the case as well, but is there a scenario where Melvin could close without initiating a gamma squeeze (assuming we continue to hold)? 


4. Melvin and other short sellers get the option to close their shorts with cash instead of shares

We are gobbling up shares like crazy to try and fuel the squeeze. However, is there a possibility the share lender would let the shorts pay back the shares in cash instead of shares, therefore not causing more of a squeeze?

As I said this is probably not a complete list and maybe some of these aren't actually risks. Anyway, let's talk about these and any others I may have missed so that no matter what happens, we have a plan to deal with it and make sure we're all benefitting as much as possible from this wild experience.

ICYMI - Robinhood makes most of its money from Citadel and other market makers,"Now that Robinhood has stopped its users from buying $GME options, this seems like a good time to remind everyone that Citadel is one of their biggest sources of revenue:

This is a strange coincidence given that Citadel bailed out Melvin's risky bet on $GME to the tune of $2.75 billion.

It's also probably just a coincidence that the purchasing of large tranches of OTM $GME options were responsible for the gamma squeezes we've been seeing (as MMs bought shares to cover these options), and a big enough gamma squeeze could eventually create a tipping point for the MOASS.

What do I know though? I'm just a tard having fun on the computer while my wife is busy with her boyfriend. None of this is investment advice or even logical thought. My diamond hands own 400 shares of $GME. Bless. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Fair Value Price of GME is 1.2x Itself.,"Consider a company with no assets, income, expenses or costs. Just a shell company.

This company has 10 shares, which are traded freely in a market, lets say they trade for $1. This share has been shorted 14 times. Each of those shorts has a margin account of $1, in total $14 exists to guarantee their short positions. For each $1 of stock, $1.4 of collateral is present (the tendies).

Lets say, savvy investors realize that the $1 investment corresponds to $1.4 of capital of the short side of the trade, and bid the price up to $2. Now, at that price, shorts are required to provide $2 per share in margin. Now each $2 outlay corresponds to $2.8 of short capital. So, on and so forth $4 and $4.8, until enough short positions are covered or are liquidated, that each marginal investment of $1 nets less than or equal to $1 in short capital, as long as shorts keep meeting margin calls.

Assuming an even split of long and short recouping the difference, the value of a share of GameStonk is literally worth a multiple of itself, 1.2 with current 140% short interest..

These hedge funds really think they are shorting GameStock, but they are really just investing in the South Sea Trading Company Bubble.

GME: Massive increase in gamma squeeze severity if price remains high till EOD Friday. AKA Buying and holding IS WORKING. KEEP IT UP.,"See my previous post first to understand the story thus far:

https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l60euz/theory_the_hold_is_working_and_the_squeeze_is/

# Wed 01-27

Fantastic trading day. 


Up 97% on the day to close out at $345 battling all through the $300s all day.


Curiously small amounts of volume all day leads me to believe this was small
amounts of short covering and paper hands selling on each bump (we'll know more
when Ortex posts data in the morning).


Yes it took a bit of a dip in the after market, but I expect greatness from our German
brothers and sisters to keep the momentum up today. The plan is the same: buy and hold. 

# *It is working*.

What's most interesting rn is the new $ amount of calls about to expire.


I had to compile a spreadsheet for this from multiple sources because my usual
source didn't have the complete data (highly sus? Are they trying to hide this
data?)

Spreadsheet:

https://imgur.com/a/zXTeR4t

This is essentially just the options chain you can look up. But, if you take
the Open Interest (how many contracts are alive), multiply that by the latest
close price * 100 and then sum all the contracts you get the total amount of $ of shares that are about to be
exercised. 

What's crazy about GME right now?

# EVERY CLIT LICKING CALL IS ITM

That is *insane*. Never seen it before.


Tuesday ended with all those options worth $800mill 


Wednesday? They jumped to $3.5 *billion* and it will continue to rise as share prices rises. Buy and hold.


Two things are gonna happen b/c of this:


-1. Mega Gamma Squeeze. MM's who weren't properly hedged before are about to be (they will have to buy shares on the market
in order to cover these calls expiring higher than their delta position). But remember, all you degens are buying and holding, so there's low af volume and prices skyrocket with every share we *force* them to buy. Read this:
https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/26/gamestops-gargantuan-gamma-squeeze/


tl;dr


> If the stock continues to rise, the market maker's delta position also
> becomes increasingly negative at a faster rate due to gamma, requiring more
> buying, which pushes the stock even higher still, and so forth. This
> phenomenon is known as a gamma squeeze and the feedback loop resembles a
> regular short squeeze.

*feedback loop* you say? 

# Sounds like tendie rocket to me if everyone holds.

-2. Many of these shares can be exercised into proper diamond hands instead of in MM's accounts that will 
loan them back out to shorts. Further squozing the squeezees. This, however requires the owner to put up another position to
exercise.


Moral of the story:


If GME holds or even goes up further Thur & Fri this gamma squeeze could very
likely be the catalyst for the big squeeze come next week.


And it will be *epic*.

**u/deepfuckingvalue:** Likely to become the worlds first trillionaire after Infinity War. Enjoys Seinfeld. Possibly a virgin. The original retard. 

**Lord Chen of BB:** Nimble. Very hard to understand... on purpose. Told securities commission he had no idea why his stock was going up, later that day releases PR of Baidu partnership. ‚ÄúOH so Sorry SEC, me no speakaaaaaa any Engrish‚Äù

"A game theoretic approach to this phenomenon of an overshorted stock's value not being derived from fundamentals, but rather from squeeze potential","Suppose all fellow retard shareholders of GME morphed into one single person (ideal scenario). We'll do this to simplify what's going on here, and what's going to happen.

This person is you. You know that there are extremely greedy hedge funds who borrowed and sold the shares to you, betting GME goes to zero. You know that there are extremely greedy lenders that literally lent out shares they didn't even have, just to collect a little more interest on loans.

If you just hold, just sit tight, refuse to sell, the hedge fund shorts will hemorrhage from the absurdly high interest payments on the loaned shares.

It gets even better. If even one person has a single share sold short, in theory you could bankrupt that person by refusing to sell. You hold immense power and control now.

Knowing this, you offer anybody trapped in a short position a lifeline. You say ""hey, I'll let you live, I just need 90% of your net worth for these shares."" What would that person do when faced with the choice between bankruptcy and starting over with 10%? Obv buy the shares back. 

It's literally name your own price now. We have them in checkmate, you just cannot sell. They are fucking terrified because they got caught.

If you own GME and REFUSE TO SELL, then *in theory* the value of a share is equal to the (sum total net worth of everybody and every fund who short sold just one or more shares divided by the total number of GME shares) times 0.90 or so to let them off the hook. They would pay you that.

Now, back to the hive.

I'll let the game theoreticians figure out what happens when you add selling pressure to the WSB swarm. Selling pressure will be a function of risk tolerance. For example, paper hands sell when the GME share they have exceeds 5% of their net worth, etc. We need to estimate average net worth of a GME long, and average risk tolerance.

The game theoretic equilibrium state of a long vs short war probably looks like 50% of shares sold short, 50% longs. The shorts are trying to get the longs to sell, and the longs are trying to get the shorts to buy. 

In this current state, I believe so long as GME is above 50% short interest, the stock will continue to rise.

GME Wars: Suits Strike Back. WARNING FOR ALL YOU FELLOW AUTISTS,"Obligatory I‚Äôm not a financial advisor this is not blah blah blah.

Okay GME gang. We‚Äôve got the shorts on the ropes. They‚Äôre bleeding hard and all the billionaire suits are shitting themselves out of fear. They‚Äôve tried false information, getting on CNBC and screaming for regulation of our ‚Äúmarket manipulation,‚Äù trying to get us shut down, Biden administration tweet, saying shorts have already covered, etc. None of it has worked so far and they‚Äôre still bleeding money.

Now they‚Äôre truly desperate. What‚Äôs something they haven‚Äôt tried quite yet but very well could be setting up to do?

MARKET CRASH

Yes, that‚Äôs right. I believe with what I‚Äôm currently seeing, they are going to crash the market and blame it on us. Do I think you need to be concerned about GME? No, because holding it should still work and they still have to cover anyway, but this is definitely to try to get you scared and sell GME and so they can take your money back when you reinvest elsewhere.

I don‚Äôt think I have to tell many of you that the current levels are at/above where the market was valued in 2008 before the crash according to the Buffet indicator. All this says is that we‚Äôre probably in a market bubble, and it‚Äôs been at these levels for months now. But guess what just started getting talked about by all the suits? That‚Äôs right. A bubble. And who are they blaming? Us.

Now that I have your attention, let‚Äôs look at a few other things.

[This is the Volatility Index the past week.](https://imgur.com/gallery/C9ETmMR) Notice how it‚Äôs been steadily rising and suddenly spiked today? 40 is typically the resistance before the market makes a downturn. If this thing gets above that we‚Äôll probably be seeing the market dropping quickly.

Additionally, there the spurts of high volume absolutely dumping stocks for short amounts of time. That‚Äôs one of the first things I noticed before the March crash and I‚Äôve been seeing it get more and more abundant the last few weeks and picking up a lot today. [Notice the large red volume candles on the weekly SPY chart.](https://imgur.com/a/w0y33Lq) (Robinhood screenshot on a DD post??? Yes, I know. I‚Äôm on my phone with limited time. Deal with it lol.)

Now you might say, ‚Äúit‚Äôs earnings season and there have been some bad earnings so far and that‚Äôs expected in this tough time.‚Äù Well yes, but there‚Äôs the Apple earnings today. They beat earnings pretty nicely and what did the stock do? [You guessed it (I hope).](https://imgur.com/a/Txc7po6)

Currently we‚Äôre seeing fundamentally strong companies as well as the S&P 500 beginning to drop and the volatility increase market wide. You could say this is ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù pulling out because they see the overvalued stocks. However, there were many worldwide financial issues sparking before the March crash. It just needed a catalyst, AKA global pandemic. Now we‚Äôre in a similar boat. Market issues in need of a catalyst.

What is that catalyst this time around? That‚Äôs right. A bunch of ‚Äúmillennials on a message board who have no place in stocks creating a market bubble.‚Äù Basically this isn‚Äôt smart money pulling out here. It‚Äôs MAD MONEY (hi Cramer). They are declaring WAR. They are pissed that we are ‚Äústealing‚Äù their billions on billions of dollars from them and they will do whatever it takes to get you to sell and take your money away from you again, including wrecking the market and the economy once again. The suits are out for blood now.

Do I think this will effect GME much? Only if you don‚Äôt sell. All this is scare tactics and ways to win your money back if keeping GME suppressed fails even more than it already has. There are hardly any shares to short if any at all and retail investors and autists are likely the ones holding most of the shares that could be sold.

Be careful out there autists

Also, a boatload of memes, ""can't stop, won't stop, Gamestop"" quotes, and if awards were a stock they would be spiking in value due to this subreddit. 

Inevitably there will be a movie and more of the truth will come out that this is a random group of retail investors and that hedge funds are the ones who should be investigated by the SEC for decades of privately sharing information and swaying the market with their price targets and interviews on the news. 

Not only are us retail investors curtailed on various platforms on when we can trade and what types of trades we execute pre/post market there is already information asymmetry with the information hedge funds with deep pockets can pay for and what we have access to. Yet somehow, sharing information publicly where even hedge funds can view it is seen by these delinquents as ""unfair"". I call bull and also call a Netflix movie on all this!

If I was buying calls on the movie date I would aim for a late fall 2021 expiry. But, I would pick up some additonal calls at good value for an end of summer time frame. Who's in this to expose what is really happening in the market with the hedge funds?

What is the short interest after 1/27?,"Has anyone posted what the short interest is after today? Trying to figure out how much of this is gamma squeeze vs shorts covering.

As of yesterday, I calculated that $154 was the average short price based on the total number of shares short vs volume held (new shorts are entering as others are closing out, which means the average short price will be going up).

The closer this price is to the actual share price, it would mean many have covered, right now since it's half the share price, I'm inferring most have not covered yet.

Other important price targets are basically the call expirations for 1/29. If the share price is above the strike prices, the more contracts will get executed thus further gamma squeeze.


Edit:
based on data posted here, I'm estimating that about 30M shorts exited, 15M shorts entered, another 5M maybe exited AH so avg short price at $204 with 40M+ short outstanding, 80%+ of float

this is a conservative estimate, meaning actual short interest may be much higher

A reminder: the stock market is not a good place for moral crusades (unless you want to lose your money),"This GME thing has been unreal. There are legitimately WSB millionaires made off this one play. This is history, and I'm glad to have witnessed it.

But I'm seeing a worrying trend here. People are beginning to make this into a moral crusade against ""the man"". Taking down the hedge funds because of their over-greed is no longer a way to make crazy money, it's a moral imperative. Giving advice to hold GME forever, just to punish them.

WSB is not the only thing driving GME up. WSB first noticed it and so we got in early, but other players are also involved. We cannot squeeze Melvin to infinity. Eventually, the position will be closed.

I don't know where the top of GME is. It might be $500. It might be $1000. It might be $10,000. But eventually, the stock will revert to its fundamental value. It happens with every short squeeze every time. And someone is going to be caught holding the bag.

If you are one of those ""I'm holding forever"" people, that person losing all their money is going to be you. The stock is going to crash from $100,000 or wherever it ends up, and when you finally decide to sell Robinhood is going to freeze for 15 minutes and it will congratulate you on your $6 sell. Meanwhile the institutional investor with their real broker made a killing. 

Now I can't wait for the loss porn that is coming to this sub in a month any more than the rest of you. That's what this sub is about. But when that happens, remember, it wasn't ""the man"" who made you lose all your money. You were the one who decided to hold at GME $1,000,000 to fuck Melvin. And you loved the feeling of that green dildo so much that you didn't notice the giant red one coming straight for your ass.

Point72 claims to be down 15% because they are backstopping MC. I caution that is a spin piece and Point72 could be taking the market down intentionally to gain.,"Today the markets were entirely down.  I saw the post with the NY Times article that Point72 is down 15% because its backstopping Melvin Capital. I thought it would be smart to review their holdings to see what is going on.  It certainly looks like holdings are being sold off to generate capital.

**However, I think this is a play by Point72 to get people to jump on the bandwagon and push them them down further, which is exactly what they want.**

In reality, I think it is more likely that Point72 pivoted to puts and are fire selling long positions to drive the price down.  Could they be pissed at the Market Makers for the GME blow up?  Would the MM be left holding the bag for this play? If that's the case, there is excellent smoke screen with the Melvin Backstop ""losses"" and Point72 needing to get more liquid Friday last week.

**I speculate they literally ran one fucking algorithm on every single one of their long positions. It bought PUTS Monday 10:15-10:30am and then it sells off huge volume of shares everyday at 3:45pm.  Selling large volumes of shares into the close to ensure it is low, swing the after/pre markets lower, so its a gap down open and closer to strikes. The small spikes on Monday around 10:30AM could be the Market Makers buying the underlying positions to hedge?**

"Useful DD, particularly if today made you wary","Thank u/dmtran1987 when GME prints for you next week, I‚Äôm posting it because they don‚Äôt have enough karma. 

**Okay Autists. I know this is long, with a lot of numbers and concepts, but bear with me. This is good stuff.**

When I was watching the trading today on GME, I noticed something strange regarding the price action and the volume. If you noticed overall today, GME traded around 94 Million shares total. Yesterday total shares were 178 Million. Day before that 177 Million. Day before that, 197 Million. The day before that, 93 Million. Ever since we started ripping up in price, the volume has been around 200 million shares per day. But today, when the price was so high, and with so much volatility (change in price), the total volume was only 94 Million!!! If you look at the one minute chart, by the end of the day average volume per minute was 98 K / minute. And during these crazy downward dips throughout the day, the volume was sometimes as low as 8K. 8k out of 50 million float = 0.016%. That means 0.016% of the total shares changed the price so much!! This doesn‚Äôt make sense. Yesterday‚Äôs average volume/ minute was 500K per minute. Which makes sense for the crazy price movement we had yesterday.

**I think the reason why we had crazy lows and highs today was because of short selling.**

Short selling from day traders who want to make quick profits in the day and get out by the end. Once we hit $385/ share (premarket high ‚Äì day trading short sellers like to use premarket high as a good short starting point because they know a lot of long day traders and paperhanded autists will sell at that point), the short selling day traders came in and started shorting hard to make their quick profits. That‚Äôs why you see the borrowed shares on iborrowdesk.com low around these times. And you have been seeing it fluctuate throughout the last few days. So I think these day trading short sellers were pushing the stock down the whole time, and when the end of the day approached, they covered their position, and we went back up to 344 close, and 373 (close to premarket high where we dropped during the day) during the first minute of after hours.

**Why is this good?**

Because that shows us these massive dips in the day are not because large amounts of autists and every day people are selling, but because the day trader shorts are synthetically pushing the price down. That means we‚Äôve been diamond handing. And even better, the normies are all diamond handing too. Guys, this is on the verge of the squeeze! Don‚Äôt sell and let this shit ride. I believe if we can push past 385 tomorrow, this shit will rip, as no short selling day trader will want to risk getting squeezed. And the crazy enough ones that do will trigger moderate length shorters to cover. Which will have the stock break out higher. Causing the breakout and momentum traders to come join us for the fight. Shit‚Äôs gonna rip. One hedge fund gets liquidated‚Ä¶ more covering‚Ä¶ another hedge fund. 

**Domino effect guys. Game over.**

Some of you may argue that TDameritrade and other brokers prevented trading GME, so that‚Äôs why the volume was low. But check this out, AMC was on that TDameritrade block list too! And they traded 1.19 Billion shares today. That‚Äôs billion with a B. With the average share per minute 2 million/ minute. And we only traded 197 Million. This is not normal. Not normal for a stock that‚Äôs breaking headlines.

"Citadel, Melvin - Why Options didn't trade for 15 mins today. Long GME, go üêªon SPY QQQ","Like many of you I woke up today trying to see if I was gonna hit my second M and was a little shocked at seeing that I couldn't get a bid or ask on any options that I had. I have literally never seen this before, and honestly I didn't know it was legal for MM to not offer any bids or asks at all.

I've also been wondering why Citadel bailed out Melvin. What is their relationship? Well see, Citadel is one of the largest market makers in the US. They are the ones that sell us the options that let us weaponize degen and yolo into riches that we promptly burn up. Citadel also holds a large short position, so presumably they bailed out Melvin because they did not want to start a liquidity cascade that was gonna eat them alive too.

Questions I've been wondering and I think I have a theory for

1. Melvin was supposed to go BK at GME 175. They claimed they exited their short. What happened?
2. If you go here [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings\_tab\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link) 3rd page Melvin has had 54k put positions on GME since 2015. Who wrote those?
3. How did GME get naked shorted when only Market Makers are allowed to naked short?

I suspect that Melvin did go BK today. They got acquired by Citadel. They bought those put options from Citadel and Citadel has held the naked short position all these years. Risk management at these market maker desks will absolutely pull a bid and not offer if they think they are at risk of blowing up the firm. IMO Citadel market maker desk didn't trade shit the first 15 minutes of the day because they were trying to figure out what the fuck to do. I don't know if they made a last minute deal this morning or pulled capital together or what but they are on their fucking last leg.

Look at Melvins long positions, a lot of them fucking sold off heavy early today. PINS. PYPL. JD. NFLX. IMO options were not traded by Citadel during first 15 minutes today while they sold off what they needed from Melvin to maintain liquidity.

I made this post a few weeks ago about why market indices are at a risk this week and last week if we see any red. Gamma is basically almost negative. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzz0jn/been\_too\_long\_since\_weve\_had\_a\_bearpocalypse\_post/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzz0jn/been_too_long_since_weve_had_a_bearpocalypse_post/)

Citadel is almost BK and everyone can fucking smell it. We get one last big green on GME IMO and that will be the death kneel of Citadel. I don't know if it happens thursday, or friday, but it's coming. You YOLO on some 550c expiring Friday if you see volume in them. IF you see market red as shit tomorrow, you buy index puts and puts on whatever Melvin and Citadels longs were and you lean into it because not only is Citadel going to liquidate but the whole market is likely to go with it.

Good luck

Thank you Matt Phillips and Taylor Lorenz for enacting the same level of distain for us as the hedge fundies our tax dollars bailed out after the Great Recession. 

You mischaracterized both the type of people involved in this action (literate, engaged, working poor to middle-class) and the action itself (is it greedy to spend our paychecks wringing dry hedge funds who daily manipulate the markets in milliseconds while we are forced to drop a few bucks here and there and hope for the best?).

A message from your cuckly Gay Bear,"Hello fellow retards. I am your local commie cuckmaster the Gay Bear! And I have important bullshit for you to hate me for.

But first things first. Good job with GME! Those bastards at Melvin and Citron don't deserve the title of Gay Bear. They spew lies and spread propaganda in order to decimate companies, and now it looks like GameStop is on the way to completely revolutionize their business model all thanks to you!

Now back to my commie bullshit.

While you autists have been hyperfixated on GME, the rest of the market decided to take a dump. SPY broke a bound it's been holding on to since last November. Also, the Pring's Special K indicator is closely approaching a lower bound. If you don't trust this indicator, I can assure you that I have done lots of Special K (the hose tranquilizing kind) when a flying midget told me that I can trust it. 

Now that you know it's real, it's time to wildly speculate on why the market would react like this. First of all, if anyone hates commies  more than you, it's hedge fund managers and market movers. They think that communism is when the government takes away their money and gives it to ingrates like you. What a bunch of idiots. 

Now that they think you're basically worse than china, they would rather bring down the whole system out of spite than to acknowledge that you've won.

Also, remember that the orange haired troll printed off money wherever his micropenis pointed to, and now the senile hair sniffer is worried about something called a ""deficit"" whatever the fuck that is. 

So with that, if SPY doesn't recover tomorrow I'm going to drop whatever I've been holding on to and go balls deep on GME, BB, and AMC calls.

Charitably-Minded Autists,"Probably doesn't belong here, but I honestly don't think the Submission Guidelines were written with these kinds of gains in mind.

Many of you probably know this already, but if you're charitably minded you can really maximize your gift by donating APPRECIATED stock directly to charity instead of selling (incurring tax) and gifting cash.

A few fine print items to note:

-Donating stock that you have held for less than a year (short term gain) limits your deduction to your original investment (basis) to the stock. If you have held the stock for long term, you get to deduct the fair market value at the time of the gift. (üíé‚úä)

-Charitable deductions are below-the-line deductions, meaning that you would need to itemize your deductions in order to get proper credit. If you take the standard deduction instead, your maximum deduction is $300.

-Your gains are added to your Adjusted Gross Income. If you do itemize and want to claim deduction you need to understand that your deduction is capped based on your AGI and the type of property you are donating. For cash, you can deduct up to 60% of AGI. For appreciated stock, you can only deduct up to 30% of your AGI. The IRS permits a 5 year carry forward for charitable gifting if you exceed these limits.


None of this is tax or legal advice. I just like the stock.

"If you want to know when to sell, read this.","# WHY WE HOLD?

First, let‚Äôs talk about fish. What do they do before they die? They jump around; they try to escape; they make noises. If your hands are weak, you let the fish escape. Now you cannot feed your family because your hands are just made of paper.

I know you are scared, me too. Especially when we thought we lost our guidance today after trading hours and we saw the price dropped without an ability to do anything. For me, I‚Äôve just bought some more at $350 for 16k and I was scared shitless. I‚Äôm not gonna lie.

But, you should know that THEY ARE SCARED too, even more than us. You see, Melvin is nothing but just a big fish to us. This fucking shark I gotta bring it down not only to feed my family but also yours. But before we defeat them, they will use every dirty trick to fuck us over to win back this game. You will get hurt if your hands are not made of diamond. So HOLD IT tight, like you hold your wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs dong.

# WHEN TO SELL?

When you see the price goes up 5 times, 10 times, 50 times, or even more from one day to a week. That is when the short-queeze happens. That is when you sell. If your hands are made of paper, sell your position when it‚Äôs 5x. If your hands are made of wood, sell it at 10x. And so on so forth.

DO NOT SELL IT WHEN THE SQUEEZE DOESN‚ÄôT HAPPEN YET. I repeat, **DO NOT SELL IT WHEN THE SQUEEZE DOESN‚ÄôT HAPPEN YET**. This is a phenomenon that happens only ONCE in your life. You don‚Äôt want to miss it.

TL;DR: Only sell when you see the price spikes up 5x, 10x, 100x from one day to a week. This is the way.

I LOVE THE MOVIES: Part 1,"TLDR: buy AMC shares. My position: 7600 shares at $14.78 cost basis.

How many people have you heard talking desperately about getting out of the house? About how ‚ÄúI just wish I could go to the movies again!‚Äù People are FED UP with being cooped up inside. As soon as spring/summer rolls around AMC is going to sell out every single showing. 

But people will be scared to go out still!!? But they will be careful!!!?

Bullshit. I‚Äôve seen soccer moms and dads cut off locks from Chicago city playgrounds during the height of the pandemic just to get some playtime in for their kids. People are tired AF of waiting around at home and are desperate to go to the movies, buy some overpriced popcorn, and get 5 hours of sugar sweats from pounding a pound of sour patch kids.

I REALLY LIKE THE AMC STOCK.

What happens when movies sell out over and over again? Price hikes! What happens when prices get hiked on a product that has zero marginal cost like a movie license? Huge profits! What happens when you buy a coke for $15 that cost $0.30 cents? Huge profits! What happens when your labor cost is minimum wage because everyone is unemployed (ok nevermind they always paid minimum wage)? Huge profits! What happens when a year of huge profits allows you to reinvest in a new and better movie experience and drive further growth? Huge profits! What happens when the stock is immensely oversold short? Huge profits!

I'm Sick of Hearing Wall Street Act Like We Can't Handle Risk,"On CNBC, the hosts and the interviewees kept circling back to how retail investors are in over our heads.  As if we're all so dumb that we don't realize these stocks can go down just like they can go up.  Motherfu\*\*er, have you even been through this subreddit?  We know exactly what the risks are.

This is the sub where people post graphs from March showing themselves 1000X'ing on Puts and then losing it all right back.  We get it more than you do CNBC.  We know there is risk.  Stop acting like you need to hold our hands and protect us.  That's bullshit.  None of you actually care, you're just upset that retail is absolutely killing it while your shitty portfolio is selling off.

What exactly are we risking anyways?  Most people on WSB are young with maybe a few $10K's in the bank.  We are the exact people who should be taking risks.  $10K invested in the stock market even over the next 30 years isn't gonna change your life.  These guys are flying around in private jets telling you to save for retirement so that you won't get kicked out of your shitty apartment at 65 years old.

This is a moment in history where billions of dollars have flowed from the rich to the poor.  Where it'll end up, who knows, but I guarantee that we'd rather play the game and take the loss if it happens than sit on the sidelines and play it safe.  The truth is that if you want to make it in this world, you have to take big ass risks.  The downside is usually overstated.

So yeah, fuck off CNBC analysts and stop telling us you're worried we'll get hurt.  That's not your real worry.

They want to say we dont know fundamentals? 250% float isnt fundamental,"Investopediaüíéüíéüíé has this article talking about shorts and floats:

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortexceed50.asp#:\~:text=A%20Company's%20Float%20and%20Short,to%20as%20the%20short%20interest](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortexceed50.asp#:~:text=A%20Company's%20Float%20and%20Short,to%20as%20the%20short%20interest).

&#x200B;

Here's a couple key takeaways:

* Theoretically, the maximum amount of a company's float that could be shorted is equal to the float itself; although, in reality, it's rare for a stock to have a short interest greater than 50%.
* Short selling is an [advanced trading strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trading-strategy.asp) used by investors to speculate on an expected price decline of a stock or other [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp).

Note that the fundamental here is that it shouldnt be above 50%üí∏üí∏üí∏ normally, let alone 100%. It shouldnt even be an idea under normal circumstances. We didnt create this non-fundamental scenario. They did.

Also note that shorting is called ""SPECULATION."" Speculation is not wise, well informed investingüòíüòí. They are betting and they always warn that it is betting. They warn non-stop that you should be very careful. They scare you away from these massive profit potentials and hide behind complex ideas.

Once they start losing, they suddenly change their tune üé∂üé∂. They claim we arent paying attention to fundamentals. That we are inexperienced and making dumb moves. This is the most shrewd, clever, intelligent market move made since the Big Short. The institutional investors got caught with their pants down üòò in public and blame us for calling them out on it.

The biggest risk we face (and why it's nothing to worry about for now),"Greetings all. Bit of background: I've been on this sub for years (was even a mod temporarily when /u/only1parkjisung modded a bunch of people for fun long, long ago), and I've been in the hedge fund world for about a decade (I'm a sell-side analyst; won't go into more detail than that as it isn't necessary). I mention all of this because I know both how this world works and how the hedge fund world works, which gives me a unique insight into what might happen next.

I won't make any predictions on GME, BB, or other stocks, because I don't think the squeeze's biggest risk right now is there. Rather, the biggest risk comes from what we've already seen happen over at Discord with the shutdown of the server. Note that Discord has had significant investment from private equity funds including FirstMark Capital, Greenoaks Capital Partners, Index Ventures, IVP, Greylock Partners, Benchmark, Accel, General Catalyst, Ridge Ventures, Spark Capital, and Tencent Holdings. At least one of these firms has invested with Point72 Ventures, which recently helped Melvin Capital. So it's not too surprising that strings were pulled to get the Discord channel banned for ""hate speech"" (which is a very useful brush to tar anyone with, as anyone who challenges it can easily be dismissed as a nazi).

Now, this subreddit's long history of using several slurs is an opportunity for the hedge fund world to claim it is a hate subreddit and pressure Reddit to get it closed. I recommend the r-word and f-word be banned by mods for this reason; yes I know it is stupid and, well, r-worded, but best to play the game and self censor rather than give these assholes a single in to destroy this community.

What is the risk of Reddit getting orders from owners to shut us down? At the moment, I'd say pretty low, but the bigger it gets the more there is that risk. Reddit is owned by Advance Publications, which is owned by Donald Newhouse and the Newhouse family (some details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Newhouse). Fortunately, Newhouse's family office (think a private hedge fund dedicated to investing just the family's money) is pretty far removed from the hedge fund world afaik. The family office's CIO (details here: https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1g6j2tztzpb3t/A-New-CIO-for-One-of-America-s-Richest-Families) got her career started in the investment bank world and did not work for hedge funds, at least according to her Linkedin profile. So the Donaldson family has limited motive to stick their necks out and force a ban of this subreddit.

However, it remains a risk and a very serious one. I suggest the mods work together to get some legal representation going; if Palihapitiya was serious about investing in the WSB community, I'd suggest putting some money aside for this and for compliance. A kickstarter fund would not be a good idea because of the ease with which bad faith arguments of collusion could be made.

In short, WSB is at the mercy of Reddit's admins, who are at the mercy of its executives, who are at the mercy of the owners. While WSB is making serious progress as a revolution against the billionaires, this is a very serious weakness that the Discord ban has exposed and that mods need to work on fixing asap.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6n4ay/the_biggest_risk_we_face_and_why_its_nothing_to/,587,"""I won't make any forecasts on GME, BB, or other stocks, since I do not think the squeeze's greatest hazard right presently is there"".

"My response to Fox Business asking for an interview. MODS REMOVE MY PRISON TAT, I'VE BEEN A GOOD BOY!","Hey Brad,

First a bit about me, I'm young and have been trading successfully with my own money for the last 2.5 years and am now retired. Thanks Elon.

With that out of the way, the beautiful thing about this movement is it's not a movement with any one representative point of view. It's more of a public gathering where if one person has an idea and it's well thought through, it gets upvoted and awarded. It's truly democratic and decentralized.

The GME phenomenon started exactly this way, when a few people including Michael Burry (Big Short fame) noticed that it was trading ridiculously below book value. Others on here took notice and believe it or not, did thorough due diligence (I encourage you to use the ""DD filter"" and see some of this, it's pretty incredible work) with financials laid out and then wrote posts about it. When Chewy founder Ryan Cohen took on a large position and became another activist investor with a grand new vision, more people on here noticed and saw not only and undervalued asset but one with actual explosive growth potential given the gaming sector growth.

Then people here took notice of the fact that 148% of the float was sold short (still a bit hazy on how this is legal) and did what Wall St. and the mainstream media didn't do, they looked and saw the audacity and greed of a few funds who thought they could never lose, were completely over leveraged and then acted on this public info and posted about it. More people here noticed and more people acted.

This is done everyday by hedge funds behind closed doors. The only thing we did differently is we did it out in the open and without inside information.

With that said, I have to respectfully decline to go on the air and be a representative of over 2.8 million members of Wallstreetbets, which by design, is not a coordinated movement and should not have a representative. I sincerely believe this and am not trying to be a hero or ""anti-establishment.""

I really appreciate you reaching out and I want you to feel free to use any of this for your segment but please make sure to stress that this is just the view of 1 out of 2.8 million people and not necessarily the views of the subreddit.

$NIO: Old flames never die," 

Ok, so gather around, a proper DD incoming.

Nio is one of the stonks that most joys have brought me in WSB. Now backed by several big banks and some might consider it more institutional, but I still think it has the opportunity to have a **huge upside** like in the ol' days. In other words :

""Where there was fire, ashes remain""

Why do I think that? Because of the following:

1- Earnings will be astronomical for the stonk as **deliveries of vehicles** have been spectacular: **111% increase YOY.**

2- The company is always innovating as seen on demo day with the program related to self-driving.

3- **The company knows what its doing:** they offer shares to raise more capital and reinvest it to grow the company; they plan to open a new factory in Denmark to start covering Europe, charging stations are becoming extremely popular, and they are making a shitton of them

4- And finally they are in China if don't know about this country because you missed geography in school is the most populated country on earth and a major economic player in the world, so if the company reaches 2% of the population and sells to this 2% each year, guess how much that is? Let's do the math together to avoid mistakes: 1,393,000,000 \* 0.02 = 27,860,000. The point I'm trying to get across is that there is a lot of market to cover and expand. 

That's a lot of cars, and this is only considering china. If they start production and sell to other countries, we are looking at an incredible amount of sales, and sales lead to revenue, revenue leads to a company having a huge upside as it's a possible catalyst, and that leads you to have a stonk with a huge price increase, kick your wife's boyfriend out of the house and live in the most special place in the world: **Tendie town**, those sweet sweet tendies!

**Positions**: 200 NIO shares @ 58.36

What's my background? Well, I did a WSB fund with stonks in python using a max Sharpe ratio, that got banned because a certain stock at that moment was a low-cap, but if you followed that portfolio you would have outperformed the S&P this year by 1000% approximately.

I also published a post on PLTR when nobody gave a flying fuck about the stock and was trading at 23 USD with shitron shorting it and everybody saying it was completely overpriced. **You would be up by 66% if bag hold 'till today.**

**TLDR**: So buckle up, **$NIO** will fly again. By simple math and good management, this is meant to fly. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6m429/nio_old_flames_never_die/,457,"A few enormous banks sponsor nio and a few might consider it more regulation, but I still think it has the opportunity to have a tremendous upside.

I HAVE CREATED A PETITION FOR A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST THE BROKERAGES THAT COLLUDED AND SHUT DOWN WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO BUY GAMESTOP,"THERE IS SIMPLY NO FUCKING EXCUSE FOR THIS. Brokerages such as TD Ameritrade or Etrade either shut down or restricted their trading preventing many of us, likely **millions** of us, from freely trading our own money. It is not a coincidence that all of these brokerages shut down at the same time, potentially resulting in **hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars worth of losses.**

We know what their excuses will be: ""heightened volatility"". But all of them at the same time, really? I understand that these are unique circumstances but these are established brokers with large development teams, is it really a coincidence that all of them failed to handle larger than expected volumes?

And even if it is merely volatility, why should it be our responsibility for not being able to freely make transactions at a time when mere seconds can drastically change your portfolio value. We cannot keep allowing these powerful brokerages to fuck us **especially at times when reliable trading is most needed.** Thus, it is prudent for us to sue these platforms for not providing the services we needed in the most desperate of times. **I am attempting to contact a couple of lawyers that I know, one of which I already know would surely like to see interest in something like this.**

If you are interested in joining a potential class action lawsuit, please sign this petition, and let's get the ball rolling.  It's time to make these large platforms actually suffer consequences for their actions and not screw retail traders over like every other time: [https://www.change.org/wsbclassactionlawsuit](https://www.change.org/wsbclassactionlawsuit)

It's Simple: We Buy Jim Cramer,"Hello fellow jackasses. As we're engaged in the holiest of wars against Sellvin, I've pondered what to do after the inevitable victory when GME (hereafter referred to as ""Jimmy"") surpasses BRKA's value. We rain down weapons-grade chromesomium from the heavens, but what will the history books remember us doing with the spoils of war?


#THE PLAN


After we're done mailing boxes labeled ""extra Jimmy shares"" full of peanut brittle snakes to Melvin's Syndicate of Stupidity HQ, I propose we buy out the contract of the wax-headed Seinfeld character on CNBC. We simply shave off 2% of our collective gains, make our offer to CNBC, and collect our Cramery spoils. 


From then on, we make him the WSB mascot. Dress him as a clown and rent him out for children's burthday parties. Make him wear a sandwich board reading ""beanie babies are crash-proof"" and have him stand outside the NYSE every day until he straight up expires from old age. Legally change his name to Jimmy ToMoon? By all means.


Me? I just wanna dress him in little sweaters and take him on walks. 


I want ideas on my desk by 4.

The shorts have only themselves to blame. They were given life lines and extra capital to escape their positions. But instead they use that money and opportunity to double down. 

They call us names and make it seem like we are bandits, when in reality we are your brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles and so on. There is nothing malicious about liking a stock and buying and holding it. 

In fact, CNBC and other outlets encouraged the young generation to start investing and tell us the stock market is the greatest creation of wealth possible. 

But when we do, they don‚Äôt like us getting it right. They are the pool sharks at the table and they just want us to play to get our money. 

Hold strong in your convictions and if you‚Äôre in a certain stock remember why and do not let emotions take over. When you do, they win and you lose. And trust me when I say, we do not get a bail out.

"If we all come up with a dollar or two, we could get the best securities lawyers on retainer for a class action if the SEC pulls shenanigans","The Age of the Retail is upon us.

The brokers have given us commission-free trading. Reddit, twitter, etc. have given us a collective hive mind where ideas can be nurtured, critiqued, developed, distributed, and acted upon in concert.

However, the government, hedge funds, brokers, et. al. still practice their dirty tricks to protect their own. We should fear the systematic risk of cronyism within the halls of government and Wall Street to put the brakes on our profit making, which is our lawful American right.

The outrage, to attempt to save big money while saying its to protect us. He said we are vulnerable. He said we are too ""unsophisticated"" to understand our risks. He said that shorts at least are sophisticated. Its so stupid its laughable. As if we are simply children mashing buttons.

The WSB Index: Quantifying r/WallStreetBets ludicrous performance in 2021,"For the past few months, I've been testing a strategy that is based around discussion on WallStreetBets. I don't need to give you an introduction into what's been going on here, so I'll get right into the pretty pictures.

**Strategy**

1. Get data on previous week‚Äôs WallStreetBets discussion from Quiver Quant API.
2. Identify the five most mentioned stocks.
3. Buy those stocks at the start of the trading week, sizing positions based on how much they were talked about in proportion to each other.
4. Sell positions at the end of the trading week.
5. Repeat

I initially considered examining the sentiment behind discussion of different tickers and constructing a market-neutral portfolio, but decided that taking short positions sounded like some bear shit and chose to steer clear.

A watershed moment in Financial Mathematics: What CNBC and the Hedge Funds don't want you to know," When a party shorts a stock, it creates a liability to repurchase the stock at whatever the price is (unbounded). This liability is secured by the assets in the party's margin account. When the liability exceeds the amount of assets in the margin account, they face a margin call. Provide additional money or securities to cover the gap or we will liquidate your position and bill you for the remainder.

The monumental discovery which is in process is as follows: When over 100% of shares are short, the long position is effectively backed by the shorts, and becomes an infinite loop. If the market cap of a stock is $50Bn, there are $50Bn in margin assets backing this price. Thus stock is in a perpetual state of fair value as long as the over 100% condition holds and the shorts have the assets, regardless of price.

So now the hedge funds find themselves in a Chinese finger trap. To push their fingers together means to liquidate their positions and take enormous losses. To pull their fingers is to continue to provide margin as the price increase until they reach bankruptcy and lose everything. In their hubris, they were trying to pull.

As these funds and brokers employ tons of smart phds to understand this math, they have undoubtedly realized this, and hence they want to cut the trap. They have restricted retail trading to prevent this limitless outflow, they are trying to bully the regulators into backstopping their position, they may halt trading.

What is the maximum fair market cap of GME? It is as much capital as these hedge funds want to throw away, lambs to the slaughter, before they throw in the towel, and its first come first serve. What is the AUM of the remaining short funds, 50Bn? 100Bn? 200Bn? more?

As we have seen time and time again, the behavior of market participants is not rationale and is difficult to predict. People are ignorant of this mathematical fact, crying about the fundamental value of the retailer on CNBC. But big money is smart, they will figure out exactly how big the pot is, and they will snap it up. Even a country could do it.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial professional, nor is this financial advice, I'm just pointing out that there is a fundamental misunderstanding of this financial math. Make your own choices and invest responsibly (only what you can afford to lose). Lord knows they are doing anything they can legal or not to shut this down.

TLDR: The Math of over 100% short interest allows for 100% arbitrage losses from the short funds. This creates the possibility for the greatest transfer of wealth of all time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6jhbd/a_watershed_moment_in_financial_mathematics_what/,456,"When a party shorts a stock, it makes a risk to repurchase the stock at anything the cost is (unbounded).

Where do we go from here and who is going to step up to help us?,"We have grown to the kind of size we only dreamed of in the time it takes to get a bad nights sleep. We've got so many comments and submissions that we can't possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators. We wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isn't allowed to read the Reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses, and the admins haven't given us special access despite asking for it.

We're suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don't get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and **I am not impressed with them destroying our community** instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.

To add to this, people are co-opting our name on twitter. I won't mention their accounts, but lots of handles with ""wsb"" and ""wallstreetbets"" in them are pretending to speak for us. They're saying things that we don't agree with, driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores, and generally making it harder for us to define who we are. There's also too much political bullshit in a community that was never *ever* political. The only way I want to occupy Wall St is in a suit myself or rent-free in the mind of a blown up short.

That is why I'm throwing my support behind the Twitter handle in general. We need a way to PUBLICLY reach out to the staff of the infrastructure that is failing us so the world can see that we aren't doing anything wrong here if they don't respond. We need to be able to respond directly to a reporter that is lying to the world about our clubhouse. We can't be expected to meet any expectations when we aren't given the tools we need.

That's not to say I approve of every message or will even be in the loop for all of them, but it's clear to me we can't do nothing and we need a megaphone.

**http://twitter.com/wsbmod** aka **@wsbmod** is the only Twitter handle whose statements are directly from some part of the team.

Control the narrative - GME,"So, media have been blaming us retards for what's going on with GME and calling us out for market manipulation. But the big question is: how is GME shorted more than 100% of shares outstanding in the first place?

The answer to this is [naked short selling](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp) which has been illegal since 2008. The hedge funds such as Melvin Capital among others have been engaging in illegal activities and should be the ones who are prosecuted by the SEC.

Back to basics - GME is a 1.5x EV/Sales 12month forward sales at current prices,"Posted this (the last part) in a reply to a comment but think it deserves a post.


New shorts are pilling in, the ‚Äúnews‚Äù are building a narrative that a bunch of millennials - as if we don‚Äôt have several prominent boomers among us - are ‚Äútargeting‚Äù Hedge Funds in ‚Äúchat rooms‚Äù (mIRC much?) to create an irrational bubble and that this is a perfectly orchestrated multi-billion dollar operation!

Wanna talk about irrational? Irrational is to value GameStop at $4, with ~$2 in cash per share, a few months before a new console cycle is launched. Irrational is to keep naked short selling well above its available free float (morning start shows the most accurate free float imo) a company that has completed a major share buyback, turning inventory into cash, paying back their 6% LT debt early and attracting a major activist (sup RC? You‚Äôve been quiet lately). 

How come there were no ‚Äúnews‚Äù about this? Is everyone sleeping? How come Bank of America has had a price target of $2 for GameStop (sorry, BofA increase their PT to $10 today) for months? And by the way, what has FUNDAMENTALLY changed for BofA to increase 5 fold their valuation of GameStop? What a bunch or crooks.

You wanna know what‚Äôs not irrational?

- GME has $7b in sales in the end of a console cycle and amidst lockdowns. 

- Out of those sales +1b is e-commerce that is growing 300% YoY

-+ 50m power up members (amazon prime has 150m members)

- an established and functioning sales and distribution network worldwide

- a healthy balance sheet. 

All that while operating in an industry with a crazy TAM, with growth rates above 30% and with THE MOST DESIRABLE demographic. 


And seriously, a 3x EV/sales is a bubble for this? The e-commerce part of it alone should trade at this valuation. And let‚Äôs not forget that the only reason GME has not sold more in Q3 is because there is a shortage of product! Demand is not gonna evaporate. So discount that valuation to this year sales and you have a <1.5x time Sales/EV valuation.


So ask yourself one question:

Would you pay an +80% interest to remain short in this thesis?

An Idiot Proof Step by Step Guide for Transferring Funds from RH,"I have no real vested interest in Fidelity, but removing GME from trading makes me want to spite Robinhood.

Once you're in Fidelity go the ""Transact"" tab on the bottom right and choose ""Transfer"". Then select ""Transfer assets from another financial institution and click ""continue"" on the pop-up. Click ""Start a transfer"" and log in with the log in you created when you created your account. Enter ""Robinhood securities llc"" into the search bar.

GameStop Bear Thesis,"Because I‚Äôm a üßªüôåüèªüåàüêª I wanted to post why it‚Äôs possible that retail investors lose and the ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù wins again. I‚Äôm stupid as fuck and totally expect to be ripped apart and for y‚Äôall to run a train on my wife. But here goes.
The theory that this bubble is different from other bubbles comes from the idea that, instead of retail investors holding the bag yet again, the real bag holders are the short sellers. But will they be forced to cover?
Here‚Äôs why they might not have to:   

1) they have huge amounts of funds, including a trillion dollar lifeline from The Citadel. They can stay retarded and at a loss longer than you can stay exuberant.

2) short selling might not cause much of a squeeze. A short squeeze relies on there being more demand for stocks than supply. But GameStop is so heavily traded, that more than 100% of the float is traded every. Single. Day.

3) the smart money isn‚Äôt just in shorts. GameStop insiders own over a billion dollars worth of stock. Organizations are buying stock when their call options become ITM. There may be smart money going long the stock hoping to take a profit before y‚Äôall can.

4) Institutional investors can change the rules. They can cease trading completely on these stocks. Or, well meaning brokers can stop you from buying through their apps, which is already happening. They could arrest u/deepfuckingvalue to kill moral. They could kill this subreddit. All of these things would cause a panic and end the bubble.

5) for many of you this is your first time buying stocks. This isn‚Äôt smart money‚Äôs first rodeo. They are smarter and more emotionally and financially equipped for this situation.

Alright, I‚Äôm ready to be killed now.

This is ridiculous, they can drive thousands into bankruptcy while they make cash, however when they loose money, they stick together and show us the middle finger, call in the institutions so they can ""investigate"" 

This is complete proof that they are a bunch of wussies and that the institutions are illegitimate! 

It's easy to predict the market when they are pulling the strings, why could they not predict this?

Now they are not allowing us to trade because it is ""too risky"" while if they do it, its all fine and dandy. And the best part if they default on their debt, we will bail them out with ""quantitative easing"" with our taxes... 

Screw them all.

Company culture starts at the top. SAC, where Melvin Capital's CEO worked, and who invested part of $2.75 billion to bail out Melvin, probably ACTIVELY hired such Wall Street Psychopaths and probably viewed this kind of aggression as a positive. Mr. Plotkin himself got away with a thing or two:

""During his time at SAC Capital, he was the recipient of illegal insider information according to federal prosecutors.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Capital#cite_note-6) [*Reuters*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters) identified Plotkin as the so called ""Portfolio Manager B"" in the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission)'s civil complaint against Michael Steinberg a fellow SAC PM who was arrested on charges he traded Dell's earnings based on insider information.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Capital#cite_note-:2-7) Plotkin was allegedly forwarded several emails by Steinberg and others that contained insider information.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Capital#cite_note-:2-7) ""

Warning on GME. Once contrarian liquidity ceases to exist the liquidity cost will be huge. What you see on the screen won't reflect the fortune you are (not) going to be making.,"My fellow retards,  


GME reaches 2000$/share, or 42069$/shares. And then what? Most of you will have made a killing. Some of you will be millionaires. But you are going to be millionaires on the screen.  


Once Melvin is dead, the shorts will have to sell their shorts to have bread in the evening and all options are ITM, then what? The trade is crowded and nobody is (short) selling. And suddenly nobody is buying. And then contrarian liquidity will cease to exist. And huge disruptions with order flows are likely to happen. We saw that to a non-negligible degree yesterday, we are seeing it today. And it's going to get worse.   


GME is going to be worth gazillions on paper but you probably won't be able to sell until the price is much much lower. The liquidity cost most of you are going to incur is something you can't imagine right now and that the stock price on the monitor is and will be hiding.

* Why would the Financial Times and NBCN risk their reputation on spreading false information on WSB, Reddit and hedgefund positions?

Is it the time I dumped everything into a short film only to lost 2/3rd of funding while in route to location IN another country? No

Both times I opted not to renew a lease pre-emptively for road gigs that ended up falling through last second? No.

Honest question about short selling with regards to GME,"Hi. First of all, I am blown away with what this sub has achieved. Congrats to all of you. Hold the line and wait.. wait.. until they feel the pain.. until they start to bleed.. and then we sell! 

I was watching CNBC and Andrew Sorkin said that one reason the short is 140% is that the same share is shorted multiple times. Very simply, A owns the original share, B shorts it by borrowing from A and sells it to C, D shorts  it by borrowing from C and so on. Can someone explain if that is possible? Doesn't that mean that, in theory, the short percentage can be multiple times the float? Almost seems there should be rules to prevent this. 

By the way, I am watching CNBC and it took them a long time to ask this basic question. They will talk down on the little guys as mania, dumb money etc, but spend little time talking about how such a high short percent is even possible. Their audiences are really the wall street and not the average Joe investor looking for more information.

5K GME is a potential 400-500 billion dollar loss to wallstreet.,"Robinhood doesnt work for you they work for the order book buyers. Robinhood will suspend orders for calls and outright longs.

Yes its entirely possible the ponzi financial system collapses if GME keeps printing higher. Remember subprime collapsed wallstreet in 2008 but that was a tiny % of actual lending.

I think Robinhood will take the fall for the GME squeeze,"**mods please dont delete this.**



TLDR: Robinhood will be the fall guy for the GME squeeze.


My prediction:


Robinhood will be the only victim of what has happened these last few days. As much as I hate to say it, the hedge funds who shorted 140% of shares will walk away without any problems just as they did in 2008. These massive hedge funds know that nothing illegal has happened on reddit or in general so trying to shut us down for market manipulation wont happen.

So how will they take their revenge? By bringing down Robinhood. I would not be surprised that Robinhood was forced to prevent retail investors from trading amc, gme, bb and nok to manipulate the market enough for these boomers to recoup some of their losses.



Why do I think this?: 


Right now, as we speak RH is prevent retail investors from buying any of these ""volatile"" shares.

We know that robinhood front runs orders so citadel and others can see retail investors moves. I am willing to bet all my tendies that RH will be the only casualty from all of this. The vast majority of us have been trading on RH. With the insane amount of volume and calls going through RH, the SEC will investigate them and determine that there was most likely wrongdoing (because naked shorts apparently are fine). 

This is not advice to withdraw the money from RH, but we know the rules dont apply to the rich and the billion (probably only million by now) dollar boomer hedge funders are out for blood. 


There have supposedely been more 100% out of money calls bought through RH than anywhere else. This alone would probably get them investigated by the SEC. But NOW they are preventing us from buying GME, BB, NOK and AMC. The MMs are trying to shake us. They are trying to cause such a drop that we sell our shares to their over leveraged boomer asses out of fear of losing our gainz. 

The hedge funds are going to try to shut RH down or severely cripple it so its harder for retail investors to ever do anything like what happened with GME ever again. 


What am I going to do about this?


I am filing a complaint with the SEC and you should too.

Twas the Night Before TakeoffüöÄ,"‚ÄòTwas the night before takeoff, When all through the sub,

Not a retard was selling, Not even a boomer chub,

The shares were held with hands of diamond, In hopes that DeepF\*ckingValue was right there behind them.

The wives were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of boyfriends danced in their heads,

And Dr. Patel on his Twitter, And Chamath on the news, Holding positions and anticipating the cruise,

When out on Wall Street there arose such a ruckus, We only held stronger, to keep them from fucking us,

Away from the earth, we will fly with a flash, Now up through the clouds, dreaming of cash.

The stars on the horizon beaming with glow, Gave the luster of the tendies we began with below,

When, what to my wondering eyes should the enemy appear, But many-a-short-sellers grinning ear to ear.

With their cocky positions, so crooked and wrong, I knew in that moment it must be Citron,

More üåà than a bear, just like 2008, They‚Äôve come once again, here to manipulate,

With broadcasts and articles, screeching of fraud, They called for our takedown, but alas they were flawed.

‚ÄúNow NIO! Now NOK! Now TSLA and AMC! On PLTR, On BBBY, On EXPR and BB!

To the top of the charts! To the top of my screen! There‚Äôs only way to go! Green! Green! Green!‚Äù

For now, we must be patient, But my fellow retards, I‚Äôll leave you with this,

Tis not for the gains, nor for fame, But for those whom we will help in our Hero‚Äôs name,

Look at those short sellers and who they thought they could mock, Now all they hear is ‚Äúwe like the stock‚Äù,

It is time, remain steadfast on our journey ahead, There is little to fear, when there is no sight of red,

The stories will be legendary, of the downfall of our enemy,

And for that to thank, we have **GME**üöÄ

This is how we break the shackles and get our reparations.  This makes racism a meme.  It‚Äôs just a symptom of wealth inequality caused by those at the top manipulating and perverting our laws, constitution, and crooked politicians to continue enslaving the masses.

For those who need inspiration today.,"Be seated. Now, I want you to remember that no investor ever won a war by going bankrupt for his friends. He won it by making the MM go bankrupt for their friends! Men, all this stuff you've heard about WSB not wanting to fight, wanting to stay out of the war, is a lot of horse dung. WSB, traditionally, love to fight. All real investors love the sting of battle.

When you were kids, you all admired the champion marble shooter, the fastest runner, the big league ball players, the toughest boxers. WSB loves a winner and will not tolerate a paper hands. WSB plays to win all the time. Now, I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That's why WSBS has never lost and will never lose a war. Because the very thought of losing is hateful to WSB.


Now, we have the finest investors and tendies, the best spirit, and the best men (and women) in the world.

You know, by God, I actually pity those poor bastards we're going up against. By God, I do. We're not just going to bankrupt the bastards. We're going to cut out their paychecks and use them to grease the treads of our tanks. We're going to bankrupt those lousy hedge fund bastards by the bushel.

Now, some of you boys, I know, are wondering whether or not you'll chicken-out under fire. Don't worry about it. I can assure you that you will all do your duty. The MM are the enemy. Wade into them. Spill their cash. empty their bank accounts. WHEN YOU PUT YOUR HAND INTO A BUNCH OF GOOD THAT A MOMENT AGO WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND'S ROBINHOOD ACCOUNT, YOU'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO!

Now, there's another thing I want you to remember. I don't want to get any messages saying that we are holding our position.

WE'RE NOT HOLDING ANYTHING. Let Melvin do that.

WE ARE ADVANCING CONSTANTLY and we're not interested in holding onto anything -- except the tendies!

This might be the best outcome for retail investors on the whole,"It‚Äôs no secret that short interest on $GME has remained high as it has been rocketing up. This is because, I believe, shorts have been banking on retail investors cannibalizing each other at the top end and triggering panic selling where all gains for one retail seller come at the expense of another. 

But if retail can‚Äôt buy anymore, then retail also can‚Äôt sell to retail. So now volume plummets and the days to cover spikes up. So the doors are locked and the longs and shorts have to negotiate an exit for both parties. I think the longs theoretically have the upper hand now. The shorts are facing pressure to close and they can‚Äôt count on retail sabotaging themselves while the only pressure to close on longs is the threat of missing the absolute peak. I think a big squeeze is still on the table in this scenario, but it really comes down to how much pressure the shorts really feel and how willing to hold out the longs are. It‚Äôs also possible that we won‚Äôt see a big squeeze, but a more orderly filing out as the longs agree to take profits and keep the bubble peak relatively low. 

This is uncharted territory, boys, good luck if you‚Äôre still in!

That means if a company wants to sell product to let‚Äôs say Colorado and Illinois, they would have to have a manufacturing plant in both locations. Now if federally it becomes legal, companies can have less overhead not requiring multiple manufacturing plants doing the same thing. I think company #mjna is really ready for a take off again. It‚Äôs trading at 3 cents right now and at peak was a multi billion dollar company. I‚Äôm eager to watch where this industry grows. Get it... Grows.

Next short squeeze target: FNGR,"I have owned **FNGR** (a Chinese company FingerMotion that trades in the US over-the-counter markets that provides mobile phone and data services) for nearly a year, from $0.60 to now $12 a share.  There is a massive short-seller in the stock and his position is unsustainable, considering the direction of the stock over the past few months.

Here are the details: **FNGR** has about 37m shares outstanding. Fewer than 1m shares are ‚Äúin the float‚Äù, meaning able to be actively traded because they are neither closely-held nor restricted. The short-seller is a naked short seller (illegal) and has naked-sold about 2.6m shares short thus-far, which means he‚Äôs sold 260% more than the float. At the current share price, his exposure is 2.6m \* $12 = $31,000,000, which is huge exposure for a small stock and an increasingly unsustainable position for the short to maintain.  

FingerMotion is a small but real and rapidly growing company that makes money and has a promising future:

\-  It has four revenue streams: top-up and mobile recharge; SMS services; Portal sales; and big-data oriented Insuretech services)  

\-  It is one of only a few companies in China with access to wholesale rechargeable minutes from China's largest mobile phone providers that can be resold to consumers

\-  It does business with the top-3 ecommerce portals in China: Alibaba, JD.com, and PinDuoDuo

\-  It recently launched Sapientus, which offers big data services and just signed a partnership with Pacific Life Re to develop a risk rating tool ( [https://www.pacificlifere.com/home/library/media/press-releases.html](https://www.pacificlifere.com/home/library/media/press-releases.html) )

Because of the consistently positive news releases over the past six months, longs have been flocking to this stock, bringing it up from $0.60 (when I started buying in) to $11-12 nowadays.

As more longs read about this company and buy, the short seller ‚Äì or their broker -- will eventually have to close out / buy back their position of 2.6m shares ‚Äì and again, with a float of less than 1m shares, that will send this thing far beyond its current level.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6yxv4/next_short_squeeze_target_fngr/,386,"I have owned FNGR (FingerMotion) stock for over a year now from $0.60 to $12 a share.

Lets Get a Class Action going against the brokers! (Like Robinhood)," 

Robinhood can't stop you. Simply don't sell and there is nothing they can do. Open a new account with a different broker and buy more tomorrow. Just let your robinhood shares sit there.

A lawyer will take it. We can gofundme a page to pay for the lawyer. I would guarentee if we got a nice letter from a strong law firm out to robinhood their butthole would tighten and they would stop their play with the hedge funds.

We start our adult lives in debt and it‚Äôs so incredibly difficult to scratch and claw our way out. Now RH is messing with all these people‚Äôs dreams just to GET EVEN financially and start from zero again. Some of these gains will change these and my lives just a little bit, some a lot.

If for some reason your broker is gay,"You don't have to be in just GME to make a difference.  The way this goes is if everyone buys the most heavily shorted stocks, those that are short will be forced to cover.  Now in order to shore up losses they most likely will have to sell off blue chips to rebalance how much cash to securities they have.  This is where the fun starts to happen.  Investors that are outside of the squeeze frenzy will start to see their blue chips falling due to funds closing out their short positions elsewhere.  These blue chip investors will then say hey, I'm going to take my profits, as the January rally has been good to me and it seems a downtrend is forming.  Then more selling happens.  This triggers more covering, squeezing, selling.  The only thing that will be left at the end are movie theaters and the power that the players have.  So long story short üòè--- only seek out heavily shorted stocks because that is where the money is going and it will be.  First draft pick outside AMC and GME is..... SKT 50% short float with about a 1bil market cap.

He sips his coffee but it doesn‚Äôt taste the same, things aren‚Äôt as flavorful as he starts to realize he‚Äôll have to sell his third and fourth homes. That limited edition orange Lambo he had picked out is now a pipe dream.
He starts to wonder if things will always be this way. Will he have to choose between Nepal and Vietnam for his vacation this year rather than go to both?

A sick realization enters his mind, he‚Äôs been duped at his own game, all the years of market manipulation and getting rich off peoples misery has come full circle.
In the first single moment of ethical clarity in his life, he sees a giant green arrow rising with the letters GME and suddenly realizes the damage will be even worse than he imagined. No more $500 lunches, no more six figure quarterly bonuses.

The color leaves his face as he begins to consider how to cover his mortgage on his now less than adequate salary. Hurriedly he logs onto Reddit and finds the r/WSB sub. Frantically scrolling through posts he sees the cards are stacked against him for once. The people with 2 full time jobs invested their stimulus into GME to cover medical bills for their family. Young 18 year olds, already with $40k in school debt, put the money their grandma gave them for college into GME because they know that grandmas checks can‚Äôt cover the $100k they‚Äôll need to finish their degree. All the people who survived the last financial crisis he caused are not only angry, they‚Äôre resilient.

Reality fades away entirely as he comes across u/deepfuckingvalue‚Äôs post showing that this was called over a year ago and he could have gotten in. He begins to understand he‚Äôs in for a lot of sleepless nights as he feels the pain of becoming ‚Äúpoor‚Äù for the first time. Flicking off his computer screen in disgust, the glare in the monitor reflects only his face. 

He opens his desk drawer and begins to apply his clown makeup heavily as he prepares for one last stand against people closing the wealth gap. Tears flow down his face as the low rumble of rockets labeled GME continue to grow louder, reaching a deafening volume as 4 words he kept seeing on r/WSB are running through his head, endlessly taunting him....

Feel free to use my complaint summary if you agree:  ‚ÄúRobinhood has gone against the fiduciary duty of its market client base, along with his company‚Äôs motto of ‚Äúdemocratizing finance for all‚Äù by participating in market manipulation. Robinhood has banned the purchase of several NYSE listed equities securities including GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. This is a mockery of the United States‚Äô foundational characteristic of free markets. Clearly, Robinhood, along with other similar broker dealers, have no interest in the free market or for individual investors. Rather, they serve the interests of hedge fund corporations who have most likely persuaded these firms to engage in market manipulation in order to mitigate losses enacted by short selling.

"You absolute heroes, I cannot believe it","Slowly this year I took a deeper look into the market, I ordered books, read charts, ran spreadsheets and was making a slow and safe profit over the months. I was looking forward to learning the lingo and trying my best to make a good side hustle. 

I read news and posts and try to articulate how this has come to be, and the only way is to completely toss human greed out of the window and trust your fellow redditors. It's quite astounding and I've grown a very wholesome respect for each and every one of you. 

Before, I just came here to read silly stories, hype myself by finding people who had made more money than my salary x10 in just an option, how retarded.

I tried to explain to my (not so market savvy) friends the extent of what's happening here, and how it came to be, and most importantly how proud I am. And as I do so my largest holding starts to gain traction on WSB.

I am a Canadian male, 22, I was born in British Columbia and was taken away from my mother by child protective services, she had an issue with alcohol and heroin and it was hinted that I might've had some in my system when I was born.

Child protective sent me to live with my father, who was his own cup of tea. To summarize, my father was a drug dealer and I was his accident baby, he had not the experience or will to raise me and I was neglected my early years of life. I assume he hadn't worked out with my mother as they were just having a fling.

My grandmother, fathers side, set me up an air mattress in her kitchen when I was four years old and that was when I unofficially moved out. There was lots of restless nights at my father's and id often catch the school bus with him still being awake and drunk from the night before. There were many strangers sleeping on my bed over the years.

My family and I had always had problems with poverty, my father's money was taken when he went to jail, Ive never really met my mother, and I burned through my single grandmothers savings by needing food and school supplies.

I went to college in 2017 for mechanical engineering,  I really liked it and got great grades. I met the first woman I've really, really liked there, we got along perfect. 

Nearing the end of my second year she grew distant and ended up cheating on me with someone in my program, I dropped out and refused to see her again. I was on OSAP student loan program which was tanked by Doug Ford, I had to pay it all back.

Since then I have been working as a cleaner at my local courthouse, I save money in my brokerage, buy groceries for granny, and am trying to pay off her debt (abt. 9000CAD).  I don't talk to either of my parents, obviously. But I am worried because she is now 71 and showing signs of mental decline. 

I was planning on going back to school, university (Bachelor of Engineering (software)/Masters of Business administration) in 2023 or 2024 if I had saved up enough to reasonably support myself, continue work, and go to school.

I sit here watching gamestop, dumbfounded, and here you are boosting my largest holding now killing my shorts. If this really works out for me I can finish school before I am thirty, and I can pay off grannys debt sooner than that even.
If this works out I swear I'll come back with my degree (and proof) and I'll train you retards with the knowledge I've absorbed. Mark my words. I really feel like I could be pulled out of poverty along with my future right now. And I  owe it all to you.

I'm crossing my fingers, I've been long for a while and do not plan on selling my little nest-bags I have here. I have 1746 at .585 average in my personal, and I have 4218 at a .61 average in my tfsa. God help me. As I write this message we are booming and I'm so proud. I hold 90% of my portfolios in SNDL.

Posted on Webull for #SLV,"Some Redditors Have Silver ETFs In Their Sights

## To say Reddit forum WallStreetBets accumulated infamy and notoriety and more in the span of a few days is an understatement.

To say Reddit forum WallStreetBets accumulated infamy and notoriety and more in the span of a few days is an understatement. Just ask market participants holdings short positions in **AMC Entertainment Holdings** (NYSE:[AMC](https://www.webull.com/quote/nyse-amc)) and **GameStop** (NYSE:[GME](https://www.webull.com/quote/nyse-gme)), just to name a pair.

**What Happened**: With [heavily shorted stocks](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/01/19346393/amc-national-beverage-and-8-more-heavily-shorted-stocks-to-watch) and their subsequent squeezes all the rage these days, WSB is drawing a crowd and with a crowd comes ideas ‚Äì some credible, some not so much.

Time will tell what comes of this notion, but one Redditor is suggesting [a Hunt Brothers redux](https://priceonomics.com/how-the-hunt-brothers-cornered-the-silver-market/), advocating for going after the silver market.

‚ÄúSilver Bullion Market is one of the most manipulated on earth. Any short squeeze in silver paper shorts would be EPIC,‚Äù [according to a Wednesday WSB post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/). ‚ÄúWe know billion banks are manipulating gold and silver to cover real inflation. Both the industrial case and monetary case, debt printing has never been more favorable for the No. 1 inflation hedge Silver.‚Äù

**Why It's Important**: Again, it remains to be seen what comes of this, but if the WSB crowd can affect the price of silver, various exchange-traded funds stand to benefit, namely the **iShares Silver Trust** (NYSE:[SLV](https://www.webull.com/quote/nyse-slv)) and the **Aberdeen Standard Physical Silver Shares ETF** (NYSE:[SIVR](https://www.webull.com/quote/nyse-sivr)).

Both of those ETFs are backed by physical holdings of the white metal.

‚ÄúInflation adjusted Silver should be at 1000$ instead of 25$. Link to post removed by mods. Why not squeeze $SLV to real physical price,‚Äù according to the Reddit post. ‚ÄúThink about the Gainz. If you don't care about the gains, think about the banks like JP MORGAN you'd be destroying along the way.‚Äù

That reference to **JPMorgan Chase** (NYSE:[JPM](https://www.webull.com/quote/nyse-jpm)) pertains to the [bank's alleged manipulation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-05/jpmorgan-s-role-in-metals-spoofing-is-under-u-s-criminal-probe) of the silver market.

**What's Next**: The Reddit post garnered 2,700 comments with plenty of WSB community advocating for the idea of cornering the silver market. Some like the idea of getting vengeance on JPMorgan for depressing their silver investments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6zeap/posted_on_webull_for_slv/,460,"Reddit forum WallStreetBets (WSB) is drawing a crowd and with a crowd comes ideas ‚Äì some credible, some not so much.

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.

One hell of a morning. I'm still holding GME, but I'm pissed and you should be too. This is a free market. We should be allowed to invest our money however we want too.  When people start making moves to limit how we invest our money, we have a major problem.  These guys are major market manipulators and we need to make sure they pay for their mistake.

Here is a copypasta that should be good enough:

""This morning (1/28/2021) I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.

Please take affirmative and direct action.""

Short Sellers: You Only Have Yourselves to Blame,"Hi Shorts,

You guys really need to stop acting like the millions of everyday retail investors who bought GME, AMC, and others are evil monsters. 

Because the fact remains that what happened this week was ENTIRELY YOUR OWN FAULT.

FIRST: 
What kind of insane idiots short a stock 138%. 

Really guys? 

That is like eating a sandwich and then saying ""Fuck it"" and then proceeding to eat your own hand because it was nearby. 

How many stocks are there out there? You could've shorted any other stock. 

But noooo lets keep shorting GME. 

This is your fault.

SECOND: 
How many fucking warnings did you need? 

WSB is not some secret cabal of anarchists. It's a fucking public message board used by millions of average ordinary people. Literally ANYONE could go on reddit and see that people have been talking about how GME was undervalued and over shorted since LAST MARCH. 

But did you guys close your positions then? 

Nope. 

What about when Ryan Cohen wrote his letter to the board? 

Or when he joined the board? 

Or any of the hundreds of moments over the last year discussed ad nauseum on this board? 

Did you close your positions then? 

Nope.

If this stock had not been shorted to the depths of Hades would the stock still have been undervalued? 

Yes. 

Would it have shot up to $300? 

No.

GME would‚Äôve still been a great investment, and buying at $3 would‚Äôve yielded a 10x return. 

Baller.

But you idiots shorted that thing to the core of the god damn earth.

So if you are looking for someone to blame, go to the bathroom and look in the mirror you use to apply your clown make-up in the morning. 

That person in the mirror is who to blame.

If you are looking for the government to create legislation to prevent this from happening again, that legislation should make institutional short selling illegal.

The short sellers are the monsters.

Stop gambling with people‚Äôs retirement funds. 

If they wanted to gamble they would be here on WSB scouring memes for stock tips.

IN SUMMATION:

Fuck the shorts. 

You guys are and have been irresponsible, malicious, and smug. 

You have made your own bed. 

Now for the love of god fuck off and shut the fuck up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6zdz2/short_sellers_you_only_have_yourselves_to_blame/,388,"What kind of insane idiots short a stock 138%.

Go against the SEC,"Given the recent events with regards to the SEC talking about shutting down the WSB subreddit, and halting trading of GME so hedge funds could adjust their short positions before losing even more money, I think we should all unite and go against the SEC, and I think that the perfect way to do so is buying the cryptocurrency called XRP.

I'll tell you why I think this the best way: on the 21st of December of 2020, one day before Chairman Jay Clayton left the SEC, they filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs., a company created after the coin (XRP) was created back in 2012, to help make XRP usage worldwide. In their lawsuit, they alleged that Ripple sold, and continues to sell, unregistered securities, aka XRP. They had almost 8 years to do so, they could've, and should've, ""protected"" investors in those years. After these news, XRP's price fell from around $0.53 to as low as $0.17, which hurt investors worldwide. The lawsuit has been reviewed by a lot of lawyers, and all of them agree that the SEC has no ground to stand on, their case will fall apart. https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1345012351280574465?s=20  https://twitter.com/Arturo\_P\_A/status/1342518861619482624?s=20  https://twitter.com/Arturo\_P\_A/status/1346245453625630721?s=20  But, in the meantime, they're artificially suppressing the price. Exchanges halted XRP trading, others have delisted it.

If you want to buy XRP and go against SEC's stupidity and market manipulation, you can buy XRP on Uphold or Bitrue.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6zhqb/go_against_the_sec/,267,"We should all unite against the SEC talking about shutting down the WSB subreddit, and halting trade of GME by buying the cryptocurrency called XRP.

"You really think a hedge fund is your biggest enemy? Well think again, naive child.","Im enjoying this sh*tshow way too much, so many naive sheep thinking they can beat the predator, outplay the casino. 

If you greedy little retards really want to make some difference you better educate and open your eyes. 

You bunch of naive noobs really think a couple of hedge funds are the culprits? You are a bunch of retards, cogs who will be left holding a the biggest shitbag of useless stock. 

You need to realise one simple thing the funds are not the problem, the currupt inflationary monetary system is. Imf, fed, ecb and corrupt corporate puppet policy makers are, the folk from world economic forum, central banks chairmen, the politicians who control this garbage fiat system, not a bunch of hedgefund managers. Cmon seriously? Bloody educate yourself. Unite, but have a greater purpose than this stupid pump and dump. Do you not realise you are being manipulated and 95 % of you are going to be dumped on, this is how the market works, you naive children. 

If you really want to make a difference, if you want a real war against corruption, against the elites, start opting out of fiat, start using deflationary, hard money, that cannot be printed, that appreciates with time as technological progress brings more goods and services that will be chasing a limited amount of money units, this is the only sustainable way for the system to thrive in a natural way where the distribution of benefits from the technological progress can be harnessed my all. Deflationary money is the answer. And the only deflationary money that meets the 21cent standards is btc.

"Dear WSB, I sincerely apologize for my paper hands today due to RH fuckery...","However, I will be taking them to small claims court in my state, suing for damages of $6500 of unrealized gains.  

RH ToS states they reserve the right to de-list or halt trading for any reason they see fit.  However, Section 13 of FINRA's prohibited behaviour states https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/choosing-investment-professional/prohibited-conduct

""13. Using manipulative, deceptive or other fraudulent methods to effect a transaction in, or induce the purchase or sale of, a security.""

If RH is able to remove the ""buy"" option of a stock at any time, then consequently, they could also remove the ""sell"" option at any time.  This removed confidence that I would be able to sell my rightfully owned stock when I felt the time was right, and compelled me to sell before realizing maximum potential gains. Therefore, I am suing RH in small claims for violations of FINRA regulations, as well as their relationship with Citadel for $6500 as just compensation for their manipulative tactics.

This community of people has united left and right, smart and dumb, and made poor people rich. And there was no news about uniting people at a time of political unrest (we don‚Äôt even talk about that here) educating people, dragging people out of debt and poverty. 

WSB did Something that big business and the government can‚Äôt do. We did all of that. Where‚Äôs the thanks, huh? 

This is not a stock manipulation community, this does not support any extremes politically, this is a community of united people, and all are welcome (unless you‚Äôre a bot or üåàüêª, and before you read into that and consider hate speech, what‚Äôs hateful about Rainbows and Bears?

This is for all the times, you took our money, took our houses, took our careers, took our friends careers, manipulated our banks, politicians and families. We relied on you to do something about this when all this happened and you did nothing. So, here we are doing ourselves, getting ourselves out, paying back debt, making something of ourselves, grabbing our bootstraps whilst sitting on the short bus and now driving the bus ourselves.

And guess what, if it was the other way round and  U/deepfuckingvalue was holding large shorts, and Wall Street was propping up the stock would Bloomberg, CNBC, FT, SEC even bother looking here?

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us.

LOVE LETTER TO FELLOW DONKEY BRAINS,"Ladies, donkeys, & idiots,


We are on the precipice of history. Though the 1969 moon landing was fake, the 2021 moon pitstop will not be. We‚Äôre well on our way, and those other donkey brained fools know it.

Today it is important to show the world we mean business, and by business i mean stocks and shit. I need a retirement fund, and the $357.53 i poured into this ridiculous scheme is going to be the biggest decision of my young life. I will hold GME until diamonds physically manifest and crystalize in my very palms, and so shall you. 

BE NOT AFRAID. The weight of history is heavy in our hands, heavier even than those of the aforementioned diamonds which will soon be prevalent in our sturdy grip.

Theyre shorting the stock...theyre shorting the free market... theyre shorting us. Today we stand, tomorrow we stand. We will continue to stand. Save the bread for those who need it so desperately. I have been heartbroken by some of the wonderful life changing wealth that has poured into the hands of those who had few options left for their loved ones in times of need.

Yes, some will feel the pressure and back out thus weakening our collective position yet HOLD the line. Hold the frontline on the war on US. The war on the individual to call the world on the nonsense gambling that has been out of reach for so long. We are the power. We are the market. We are the line.

What if you bought options expiring in 2023 or 2024 at-the-money in stocks that are not affected by interest rate hikes, like banks and gold. Rho would cause the option prices to rocket up.

A little thought,"Although yesterday√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s market behaved relatively good, the heavy at the bottom of the previous support level showed that there is money to enter the market at the current point, but I reviewed the options market and I was still very pessimistic about the performance of S&P in January.

For growth stocks, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s real panic selling, the waterfall decline has not yet come, of course, there has been a differentiation in growth stocks. At present, the price is relatively fair, and you can start to slowly buy $OKTA, $SE, $MELI. , $SQ; $BILL, $DDOG, $NOW, $NET, $S, $SHOP, which are still at high valuations. Affected by liquidity, so the corresponding US stocks $MARA, $RIOT, $MSTR, and $SI are all short-selling targets in the next few weeks. You can go PUT on rallies.

$WEN lambo,"A couple years ago me and my girlfriend were talking about ""The Mandela Effect"", a phenomenon where people believe that their memories may have been altered due to inconsistencies in reality experienced by many disconnected people. One example is that people have false memories of news reports aired after Nelson Mandela died in prison, another is that everybody seems to think that ""Berenstain Bears"" was spelled ""Berenstein"". She asked if I had ever experienced anything like this and I said that I was pretty sure Wendy from the Wendy's restaurant sign got hotter. She looked it up on her phone and it turns out that they just changed the sign. Also she said that ""Wendy"" was ten years old which I didn't know or I wouldn't have said that, but she does looks better so I don't think it's that weird to say.

Recent developments on $HIMX,"As of today, the stock price of Himax has had an enormous run from 10 to 16$ in less than a month which was followed by a massive drop of 25% to the 12$ line in just three days. Regarding this unexpected drop I wanted to update my view on the stock and the company itself.
 
 As of now, I don't (and probably can't) know why exactly this immense price decrease took place. The most common theories are that it was either a whale exiting positions and thereby triggering stop losses and panic selling or it was short sellers doubling down and having to bring an end to the rally we saw end of year. Nevertheless, both of these explanations don't change anything about the stocks potential in the long term.
 
 What a lot of trading/investing pros keep repeating is that when a stock isn't doing what you expect it to do, you have to sit back and look at it's fundamentals again. That's exactly what I've been doing for the last days and I've found that the company is in the exact same position (If not a better one) than three weeks ago. Fundamentals still check out and the opportunites behind this haven't vanished at all. (You can check out my earlier posts to learn more about my investment thesis)
 
 You have to keep in mind that this is a long term play. I'm personally not expecting us to hit 25$ before mid 2022. The volatility that we've seen in the last weeks is normal and it will probably continue like this for the next months.
 
 Because of the volatility we've been seeing and the big opportunities being long term I highly adivse you to either buy LEAPS or stocks as you don't want to see your whole portfolio wiped away by badly placed options (or maybe you do, idk, this is wsb). 
 
 This is pretty much all I've got to say about the recent price development. The stock stays massively undervalued and the market just hasn't priced in the recent earnings growth and the company's huge business opportunites which basically makes Himax a no-brainer.
 
 I wish us all good luck on this one and we'll see us again in a few months when LEAPS will be printing.
 
 Cheers.

GME 2.0?,"GameStop Corp. is launching a division to develop a marketplace for nonfungible tokens and establish coin partnerships, according to people familiar with its plans, pushing the company into much-hyped areas as it tries to turn around its core videogame business.
 
 The retailer has hired more than 20 people to run the unit, which is building an online hub for buying, selling and trading NFTs of virtual videogame goods such as avatar outfits and weapons, according to the people. The company is asking select game developers and publishers to list NFTs on its marketplace when it launches later this year, the people said.
 
 GameStop also is close to signing partnerships with two coin companies to share technology and co-invest in the development of games that use blockchain and NFT technology, as well as other NFT-related projects, the people said. The retailer expects to enter into similar agreements with a dozen or more coin companies and invest tens of millions of dollars in them this year, the people said.
 
 Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop has been working to reset its business after years of losses. The company was at the center of a stock-trading frenzy last year that dramatically boosted its share price, which rode a surge in interest and optimism from individual investors. Many saw potential in GameStop despite the pandemic√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s negative impact on foot traffic and even though consumers have been increasingly opting to download and stream games over the internet, rather than buy the kind of hard copies that the company specializes in selling.
 
 Last year, GameStop overhauled its executive team and board of directors, naming activist investor Ryan Cohen as chairman. Mr. Cohen, who co-founded online pet-products retailer Chewy Inc. and sold it for $3.35 billion in 2017, has been pushing to make GameStop more tech-centric.

Flawless Strategy For Printing Infinite Money,"The stock market opens at 9:30am. Due to algorithms and shit and more people trading at market open, the theory is that over the long run the stock price will increase 51% or more of the time between 9:30 and an arbitrary time that is close to 9:30 like 9:45.
 
 Steps to print money:
 1. Pick any stock ideally one that has a lower chance of fluctuating 2% in the span of 15 mins
 
 2. Buy 9:30
 
 3. Set stop loss of 2%
 
 4. Sell at 9:45 no matter what the price
 
 5. Repeat every day
 
 
 When you lose, you only lose 2%. When you gain, on avergae you will gain more than 2%. And since you will gain on 51% or greater of the days you will gain money guaranteed.

Did I just find the infinite money glitch?,"Suppose, I open a put credit spread. With margin requirements of Rs. 500.
 If the stock goes up, nice, I keep the credit.
 But, if the stock goes down, I could just roll the option with a deep OTM put credit spread for 490+ credit and lose $10 at maximum? You could just collect credits as long as the stock moves your way, and when it doesn't, you lose a maximum of $10?

 Edit: I got this idea, because I had a nvidia put credit with 500 margin,which I opened for around 115. I was in a loss of 150. I rolled it and got credit of 290. Ergo, maximum loss reduced from 385 to 210. Without the stock even going in my direction?

Short DD on Semler Scientific ($SMLR),"Ever been to the doctor and had this inflatable thingie put around your arm? That is, apparently, how they try to determine whether your arteries are clogging with fat, and whether you are at risk for a myriad of severe conditions such as heart attacks. 
 
 This company found a better, cheaper and quicker way; a clasp on your finger and on your toe, to measure it with electric impulses (or other magic). You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll find Quora topics on it, with people recommending the service to each other(√¢‚Ç¨Àús grandmother).

 It is a new, non-intrusive method, and they make money by charging a flat monthly fee and a fee-per-test. When a physician uses QuantoFlo, (s)he gets charged. Investors got their tits jacked after SMLR got uplisted from OTCQB to Nasdaq recently and with the company beating increasingly ambitious EPS targets ten times in a row. 
 
 Then .. drama!
 
 During the 1 Nov earnings call, they:
 
 * Missed earnings at $14 instead of $15 million, 
 * Missed EPS targets set by 3 (?) analysts by $0.19 per share, only reaching a net income of $0.51 per share, 
 * Their gross profit margin went down from 92 to 90%, 
 * They always said that their increase in operational costs will always be outpaced by their increase in revenue and that didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t happen this time.
 
 The stock price went from a close price of $149 to $111 in one day, and keeps trailing down, now at around $88. Why? Because they have a large P/E for their sector. Investors paid a premium expecting revenues to explode. Only 2 million Americans got tested and 80 million are guesstimated to be at risk. Hamburgers. 
 
 When that didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t happen a single time, they got spooked.
 
 [Oops ..](https://preview.redd.it/7s7p4cl6tx981.png?width=1677&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3ae8a24ec32a71d35b3881044ad72faab385563)
 
 **So what about it?**
 
 I suggest listening to the earnings call. The CEO/CFO said that Omicron caused the variable income based on fee-per-test - so not the flat rate fees - to go down and/or √¢‚Ç¨Àúsome kind of yet to be determined seasonality√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢. Revenue will nonetheless continue to go up YoY.
 
 It is not hard to imagine that physicians had other priorities with the Omicron variant in full effect. Same thing happened for this company in 2020, before things picked up again in 2021 after the vaccine.
 
 During this call, it was also announced that the company bought stakes in various private firms to bring to market more healthcare related products in different HCC code categories, meaning an even larger potential to increase revenue with new patients targeted. 
 
 People smarter than me crunched the numbers and investment fund Opaleye Management bought in at $114 *after the crash*. For me the immediate upside, after a solid earnings call at the end of February is somewhere north of that figure. Give it some time, and it might bounce back to $149 and above.
 
 The short float is about 1.65%, which makes me believe that the market does not think this will drop much further. 
 
 Company has no debt and has a cash position of $35.9 million at 9/30/2021 vs. $22.1 million at the end of 2020. In the earnings call it was said that dilution is not in the cards.

 **Catalysts?**
 
 Earnings call in the first half of 2022, as these PAD tests are expected to be conducted sooner rather than later. Management noted that the healthcare offices don't want to be caught in the same position they were caught in 2020, where they were conducting tests moderately until everything shut down.
 
 An announcement of the other products/services, as this is currently still on the hush-hush. The news that they already signed a first customer to a license for one of these new products got completely buried. 
 
 **The bear case?** 
 
 The P/E is still high at 32.1x after the drop, and there was insider selling by the CEO, just before the earnings call at the end of October. He unloaded 5000 shares for about $670.000.

 TL;DR: This stock is not talked about on Reddit yet, and has an immediate upside of about 24% and 62% in the mid-term. Or I am an idiot, who is to say?

Autonation is a $55 stock,"Leading up to the pandemic this company ($AN) made about $4.50 per year and traded at a multiple of between 8 and 12. It's not a great growth story. They have no disruptive technology. They sell cars. Car sales over the last couple of years have been off the charts and they've been making a shit ton of money. In my mind there is no way that that is going to continue. There are a number of reasons for this.
 
 The chip shortage is going to be a thing of the past and people will be able to buy new cars again. That means that the markup on used cars is going to plummet.
 
 Manufacturers aren't going to sit idly by while dealers mark cars up well above the MSRP and make record profits. I've read about the Ford Mach-e being marked up $10,000 and the Mercedes EQS by $50,000. Already, 12 states have legislation moving forward to allow manufacturers to sell directly to the consumers. In most cases this only applies to EVs but let's face it, in a few years that's all there's going to be anyway.

 2022 may be a good year for these guys and they may hit the analysts target of $18 per share profit but after that I see a steady decline in both revenue and profit. I was criticized for being too wordy with my last post (MRNA is a $30 stock) so I'll cut it off here.

Dealers have been making huge profit by selling cars at much higher values than MSRP. However that won't last long as markup on used cars is going to plummet. 12 states are also passing legislation that allows manufacturers to directly sell to consumers.,92
ROBINHOOD 2022?,"People always ask me, what separates your hatred for HOOD compared to others? And the answer to that is simple. Everyone else is praying on their downfall. Bitch, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m contributing to that shit. Fuck Robinhood, fuck the media and fuck the free world!
 
 Okay so remember when GameStop squeezed and for almost no explicable reason Robinhood halted all buying and selling of the stock? The betrayal could not be more ironic. Robin Hood, a tale we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve all heard before. The noble warrior does what is right by stealing from the rich and helping the poor who otherwise would be helpless in such a society. The sad truth is that Robinhood not only kept many from placing live changing trades, but they demonstrated to the common man that there is no reason to trust anyone on wallstreet, even those who try so hard to appear trustworthy by having the audacity to name their company something as deceiving as Robinhood.
 
 They tore off the hand that fed them. 
 
 HOOD is %8 down today.

What Do You Think of AFRM?,"Buy-Now-Pay-Later seems to have gotten a bad reputation of late, but I still think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the wave of the fintech future. I especially think that since AFRM scored deals with AMZN and tens of thousands of other retailers, that Q4 with Christmas will be gangbusters and show BNPL√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s durability and growth potential.
 
 Now, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been in AFRM for about six months, and boy has the road been rocky. Volatile swings along with a lot of other growth stocks, especially since the CFPB launched an √¢‚Ç¨≈ìinquiry√¢‚Ç¨¬ù into BNPL that I think is going nowhere. 
 
 Anyway, let me know what y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all think. If I should cut my losses or double down. Note: I have done some DD, perhaps not enough, though enough to know that their delinquency rates are not as big a deal, and no reason to buy puts on AFRM.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rvv38k/what_do_you_think_of_afrm/,157,"Buy-Now-Pay-Later seems to have gotten a bad reputation of late but it's the wave of the fintech future.

Tilray earnings play,"What does everyone think of tilrays upcoming earnings call, more bag holding or finally some green days? Legalization looks like its still on the back table in congress to. Im pro on tilray but it looks like it could be a while before green again. Any thoughts?
 
 Pros:
 -Germany legalization
 -Expanding american market(alcholic beverage industry and hemp foods)
 -merger saving of $80m
 
 Cons:
 -america stalling legalization
 -increased cost due to expenditures(short term rev hit)
 -revenue target misses
 -burning cash pile with heavy expectations on american markets increasing rev
 
 Possible post call outcome:
 -Earnings is a miss due to short term expenditures and stock continues to drop
 -merger savings was enough for earnings to beat expectations and it sees some green days

Snap-On Incorporated,The OG Tool of the professional technician or mechanic. This company has been around for over 100 years. You have seen their tools in your dads garage or hell maybe you even have them in your garage. You have seen their tool boxes in movies. They build the best tools and shop equipment in the industry. They also drive to your business and sell you tools. I have personally been buying tools from snap on since I was 9 and now I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m 35. I have been handing snap on over 150$ a week for 10 years straight. Ask a real technician or mechanic what tools they use.

"Zynga. Why so much open interest for JAN,21 2022","Full disclosure, i was assigned 1200 shares of ZNGA and was trying to figure out my exit strategy after rolling a put spread for months. The spread was for Jan 21 and was assigned on NYE. So my loss is minimal and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not worried. 
 
 While looking through their option chain I found that the open interest is huge compared to other dates. 380,000 plus compared to about 10-20k normally. 
 
 I went looking through the news and Matt Wolf, the VP of block chain gaming for the company said they are going to be releasing NFTs early this year. Anyone find the open interest extremely weird or what?
 
 Edit: √∞≈∏≈°‚Ç¨ I normally just comment and troll, when im not trading. I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t love the stock because there are issues with the company.

Behold the 3rd largest automaker!,"Rivian (RIVN) is a corporation damned to bankruptcy because it missed the boat on the electric vehicle adoption curve. This is because in the normal 2023 and early 2024 model years most traditional automakers will: have figured out how to make EV√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s, and more importantly produce them at scale.
 
 The bull case for disruptive tech companies in general is that they can build market share and profit margins based on that market share and product lock in. The problem is that the global auto industry is figuring out battery electric vehicles. This means that the future profit streams are going to be subject to the meat grinder called the global auto industry (one of the most competitive industries on earth)!
 
 If battery electric vehicles are not successful due to the fundamental constraints of the technology, traditional auto makers have the legacy products continuing to make money and can sell electric vehicles as a niche product to improve cafe ratings!
 
 But even more importantly; Rivian unlike Tesla (TSLA) does not have the time to develop their production capabilities, without normal automakers catching up on battery electric vehicle technology! So even if battery electric vehicles are the future: the fact is, that Rivian does not have the physical capital and know how to produce vehicles at scale. Tesla was inches away from bankruptcy, when Tesla was figuring out how to produce the Model 3! How much more so will Rivian be, when other auto manufacturers release their competing battery electric vehicles, (for example Honda√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s (HMC) release of the Honda Prologue, which is most likely to be about the size of the Honda Pilot, or Acura MDX; or more importantly the Rivian R1S! And of course, Honda can produce a Ridgeline version of the Prologue to compete against the R1T.)
 
 Unfortunately, Rivian has missed the boat. Have fun watching the stock return to her actual value! Or you can heed my warning and sell now for a great profit.
 
 This is her form 10-Q. Looks like a company worthy of being the 3rd largest automaker!

It does not have the physical capital or the production capabilities to produce electric vehicles at scale. Traditional automakers will have caught up in electric vehicles market by 2023-24 and will also continue to profit from their legacy vehicles. Which probably indicates that Rivian's stock will tank soon even though electric vehicles are the future.,93
Cash in on Pelosi and the CHIPS and FABS Acts,"There has been a lot of talk about Nancy Pelosi going long on LEAPS on a bunch of semiconductor and metaverse stocks. This made me interested in why she would go long right now. I discovered the CHIPS and FABS acts, which are both set to strengthen the US semiconductor industry. [Here is the summary.](https://www.semiconductors.org/chips/)
 
 The US needs more microchips. These acts are designed to bring manufacturing back to the US. The companies receiving benefits will flourish. Here's how we make money off this:
 
 **1) Safest option:** Buy SMH. This ETF captures the whole semiconductor industry in one shot.
 
 **2) Next riskiest:** Buy META ETF, not to be confused with Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook. META captures a bunch of metaverse stocks that will benefit from better and cheaper chips. Soon, we will have a zombie slayer augmented reality game and this will take off.
 
 **3) Buy SOXL.** This is the 3x-leveraged version of SMH. You get the whole industry, but 3x exposure to it gives you bigger gains. And since CHIPS and FABS will boost the whole industry, we shouldn't have to worry about 3x on the downside.
 
 **4) Buy individual stocks like Nancy.** Nancy went long on MU and RBLX among others. I am partial to LRCX. LRCX is one of only 3 companies that makes the machines that other companies need to make chips. All the companies that want to build fabrication facilities in the US will go through LRCX and boost sales big time.
 
 √∞≈∏≈°‚Ç¨ because you guys don't read anything without a rocket.
 
 Positions: 103 shares of LRCX, 108 SMH, 18 SOXL, 16 AMD, 489 QQQ, and 699 TQQQ.
 
 **tl;dr: buy SMH, SOXL, and META calls or shares. Buy LRCX shares.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rt16lu/cash_in_on_pelosi_and_the_chips_and_fabs_acts/,367,"The CHIPS and FABS acts are designed to strengthen the US semiconductor industry by bringing back manufacturing to the country. Some safe options to make money off of this is to buy stocks like SMH, METS ETF, SOXL, LRCX, etc. These are sure to surge due to benefits of the act.",97
