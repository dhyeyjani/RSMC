This is the institutions flat out admitting they will change the rules to bail out the rich but if it happens to us, we get a â€œwell shucks you should have known investing is risky! have you tried cutting out avocados and coffee, maybe doing Uber on the side?â€  We may have collectively driven up enough sentiment in wall street to make other big players go long on GME with us (we do not have the money to move the stock as much as it did alone). we didnâ€™t hurt wall street as a whole, just a few funds went down while others went up and profited off the shorts the same as us. The media wants to pin the blame on us.  It should be crystal clear that this is a rigged game by now. Its time to build new exchanges that canâ€™t arbitrarily change the rules on us. Cr\*\*o has some version of these, maybe they can be repurposed to be trade stock without government intervention. I donâ€™t know exactly what it will look like yet, but the broad next steps i see are - 1. exit the current financial system 2. build a new one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |242                                                                                                    |NASDAQ was shut for a while by the CEO to help investors by allowing more time to change their positions.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.  It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future.

I would play by the rules and someone else would ignore them. When they would win I would appeal to the first authority for an explanation. "Are you going to let them get away with this"? "Life isn't fair". No, it is not. The game is the game. Always.  In this moment, the fascade cracks further. When the first breach was made I do not know, perhaps it was Socrates, but today I see thousands. Millions.   Once they were laughing, luxuries falling out of their disgusting diseased mouths as they cackled. The unmistakable stench of derision carried on their breath. They told anyone outside of their elite class that we were fools for even trying. They told us that we were naive. We needed networks to be successful. We needed polish. We needed expertise. We needed THEM. The game is the game. Always.   They are no longer laughing. Their odious oeuvre still wafts through the air. While the rot, and hate, and condescention, remains, the noxious air betrays a new addition. Something all together disconcerting. What it betrays, is fear. They are afraid. And they should be. We do not need their inherited resources masked as acumen. A new day dawns. The day where we make an ever so slight step towards what they fear the most. An even field. Life becoming ever so slighty more fair.   AND. THEY. ARE. SCARED. They look at us and see roughness. We look at them and see softness. We are both correct in our estimation.  The game is the game. Always.  Fuck them in the street. Fuck them all in the street. We are the righteous. We are blessed by Phoebe. What started here will echo through time in the eons to come. Mount up and ride with the fury of a thousand rockets into the universal filament. May the wind always be at your back and the sun upon your face. And may the wings of destiny carry you aloft, to dance with the stars.

|We need to keep this movement going, we all can make history!                                        | I believe right now is one of those rare opportunities that we all can help and do good. Some of these companies like GME, AMC are good companies that's been hit hard by this pandemic. Hedgefunds and Wallstreet just want to short these companies to zero and make millions.    I really think right now we have enough support and enough of us to change that direction in history. Wallstreet says  well weak companies need to just go. 10 yrs down the road though I want to be able to watch a movie in a movie theater with my family. If we all buy and hold in what we believe in it gives these companies a second chance and we as a group can stop these companies from being shorted to death and just disappear.

|Once you're done with GME - $AG and $SLV, the gentleman's short squeeze, driven by macro fundamentals|You guys are champs. GME... who would have thought a bunch of crazy retards could reach the front page of the New York Times.  And when you're done with GME, it's time to punish the big banks who have been suppressing the price of silver since the Bear Stearns / JPM merge. It's all in fucking Bloomberg:  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-16/precious-metals-traders-charged-with-rigging-futures-contracts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-16/precious-metals-traders-charged-with-rigging-futures-contracts)  There's an excellent explanation of their scheme here  [https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/palisades-gold-radio/ted-butler-squeezing-out-the-hqxQ5mOdt02/](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/palisades-gold-radio/ted-butler-squeezing-out-the-hqxQ5mOdt02/)  You think GME squeezed hard? Look what happened to silver half a year ago in July:  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/3yssvdm7y1e61.png?width=2588&format=png&auto=webp&s=25d4cfa973d57f1f6083affdcecf6b35e4055a7f  That's one of the banks getting squeezed out of silver, having to cover their shorts... and that's just because rich boomers freaked out about financial instability and finally started calling out the Comex on their bullshit, and taking physically delivery of silver... which they don't have.  Now imagine 4 million degenerates buying $SLV, forcing the trust to take delivery of physical silver from the Comex. This isn't GME, who's fair price is maybe around $5 a share. The FAIR price of silver based on the historical gold/silver ratio is almost surely over $50/ounce. This short squeeze will be a fantastic success even if we can take silver to it's fair market value.  And then there's $AG. Because once silver starts moving, $AG is going to go to the fucking moon. 1) it's a leverage play on silver, 2) It's got it's OWN SHORTS TO BE SQUEEZED OUT.

Back when penny stocks weren't against the rules, the days of delisted tickers like OMVS and the others. I know a lot of you (about 2 million in the past couple of days) are new here, but I just wanted to say this has been one hell of a journey over the years with you guys.  I joined WSB back when I was still in highschool. I feel like I've grown up with you guys. I still remember losing $2000 on my 21st birthday when one of these biopharm companies we were all playing released their trial phase results. That was a lot of money to me then, still is to be honest, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a hell of a time and learn a lot of valuable information in losing that couple thousand dollars. I still remember how happy I was when i logged in one day to see i had finally earned a flair in my favorite subreddit as well.  It's 5 am here and I'm kind of cooked right now off the sauce, so I'm probably rambling at this point, but I just wanted you to know that I love you all and you're all some very unique people. Being here in this sub is proof enough of that to me. I hope you are all blessed with as many tendies as you can eat.

If I wouldn't close them at todays market open, they'd do it, and they'd do it for all customers with GME options expiring this friday. I could open a position expiring next week if I wanted to.  &#x200B;  Their reasoning was that I didn't have enough cash to exercise the calls and they don't know if trading of GME will be halted for some time in the next few days. Therefore my calls would get exercised with my balance in the negative.  &#x200B;  Now, I'm fine with closing the position and rolling it out to next week and a higher strike, since I also have a ton of shares. But this still sounds fishy to me, like they wanted to minimize the amount of shares they'd have to buy to hedge for another gamma squeeze. They told me I "also had other positions that were heavily covered in the media, but those were fine, GME realls is a big exception right now"  &#x200B;  \[Positions\]([https://imgur.com/a/NLXQsEK](https://imgur.com/a/NLXQsEK)) (options only)  &#x200B;  Edit: After I was being sceptical on the phone and asked if they could just close shit like that, he told me it was "a very unusual situation with big risk involved"     I told him that there are apparently enough hedge funds with no risk management either, and that we wouldn't be in this situation otherwise.

My college had been taken care of beforehand, because I'd been accepted into a program at UMass Boston for high school students with above-average grades.  A week after graduating high school I received a degree in psychology and went off to be a Marine.  I remember 2008.  I remember my father's savings being nuked, his portfolio going to zero.  Twenty years in the United States Navy and he'd had his savings completely obliterated because of the collapse that Wall Street caused.  I remember my mother calling me in the middle of the night--I was in Okinawa, Japan at the time--and crying because the savings were gone.  That day I started sending a measly $1,000 a month to my family to take care of bills and keep my siblings fed.  My grandmother's retirement was gone in the blink of an eye but she survived, because she loved her job (she was still working in her 60s at a retirement home).  But she had to get a reverse mortgage to keep the house.  I didn't have to send money too long--only about five months--until my father got a better job, and my mother was able to get her own job as well.  But I remember the desperation in her voice.  I'm 34 now.  I've done my time in the military.  No pension, I didn't serve long enough.  But now I can look at this entire debacle and fucking laugh.  I'm a capitalist at heart.  I support being paid for your services.  But I remember the bullshit you engaged in, and I know many others do as well.  Occupy Wall Street did fuck all to you.  But now the internet has given way to arguably the worst thing for you: actual communication and planning.  Now you're seeing what a group of people who loathe everything you stand for can do to you in days.  You won't learn from it, though, which is okay.  This may not keep happening, but every time you decide to attempt something like this the fear will be there, in the back of your mind.  I wish I could have gotten in on this.  I'm not able to spend money like many of these people can.  But I hope it hurts, and it seems like it is.  And there should be no mercy in a situation like this.  Hound them until they concede.  And always remember the motto of the Marine Corps, "Semper fidelis"--Always Faithful.|444                                                                                                    |I started sending 1000$ a month to take care of the bills and keep my siblings fed.

We sit there terrified hoping the big guys throw us a bone. For those of us here at WSB the last 5 years this leads to massive disillusionment. And itâ€™s all fun and games because everyone on the inside wins. How stupid is it that there is no transparency to the underpinnings of valuation and that there is 0 regulation of shorting a company and fucking itâ€™s employees beyond 100% float just to control the asset?  When the dust settles be aware there is a massively growing system that does exists which does not allow this that is called decentralized finance. Worth learning about the future early   Edit: I donâ€™t know for sure but I predict The GME situation ends when the government prints the $ to give to Melvin and friends bc this is an inflationary system and thatâ€™s what happens. Theyâ€™ll be upset they didnt just print the $ earlier. The De-FI space is backed by deflationary systems and itâ€™s worth understanding why thatâ€™s so profoundly different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |245                                                                                                    |It is stupid that retail gets no chance to participate in any stage of the IPO.
