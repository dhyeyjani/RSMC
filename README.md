This is the institutions flat out admitting they will change the rules to bail out the rich but if it happens to us, we get a â€œwell shucks you should have known investing is risky! have you tried cutting out avocados and coffee, maybe doing Uber on the side?â€  We may have collectively driven up enough sentiment in wall street to make other big players go long on GME with us (we do not have the money to move the stock as much as it did alone). we didnâ€™t hurt wall street as a whole, just a few funds went down while others went up and profited off the shorts the same as us. The media wants to pin the blame on us.  It should be crystal clear that this is a rigged game by now. Its time to build new exchanges that canâ€™t arbitrarily change the rules on us. Cr\*\*o has some version of these, maybe they can be repurposed to be trade stock without government intervention. I donâ€™t know exactly what it will look like yet, but the broad next steps i see are - 1. exit the current financial system 2. build a new one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6uhhn/exit_the_system/                               |242   |NASDAQ was shut for a while by the CEO to help investors by allowing more time to change their positions.

|SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE                                                          |Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.  It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.  DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.  It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

I would play by the rules and someone else would ignore them. When they would win I would appeal to the first authority for an explanation. "Are you going to let them get away with this"? "Life isn't fair". No, it is not. The game is the game. Always.  In this moment, the fascade cracks further. When the first breach was made I do not know, perhaps it was Socrates, but today I see thousands. Millions.   Once they were laughing, luxuries falling out of their disgusting diseased mouths as they cackled. The unmistakable stench of derision carried on their breath. They told anyone outside of their elite class that we were fools for even trying. They told us that we were naive. We needed networks to be successful. We needed polish. We needed expertise. We needed THEM. The game is the game. Always.   They are no longer laughing. Their odious oeuvre still wafts through the air. While the rot, and hate, and condescention, remains, the noxious air betrays a new addition. Something all together disconcerting. What it betrays, is fear. They are afraid. And they should be. We do not need their inherited resources masked as acumen. A new day dawns. The day where we make an ever so slight step towards what they fear the most. An even field. Life becoming ever so slighty more fair.   AND. THEY. ARE. SCARED. They look at us and see roughness. We look at them and see softness. We are both correct in our estimation.  The game is the game. Always.  Fuck them in the street. Fuck them all in the street. We are the righteous. We are blessed by Phoebe. What started here will echo through time in the eons to come. Mount up and ride with the fury of a thousand rockets into the universal filament. May the wind always be at your back and the sun upon your face.

|We need to keep this movement going, we all can make history!                                        | I believe right now is one of those rare opportunities that we all can help and do good. Some of these companies like GME, AMC are good companies that's been hit hard by this pandemic. Hedgefunds and Wallstreet just want to short these companies to zero and make millions.    I really think right now we have enough support and enough of us to change that direction in history. Wallstreet says  well weak companies need to just go. 10 yrs down the road though I want to be able to watch a movie in a movie theater with my family. If we all buy and hold in what we believe in it gives these companies a second chance and we as a group can stop these companies from being shorted to death and just disappear. Just my 2 cents!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6uao1/we_need_to_keep_this_movement_going_we_all_can/|139   |Hedge funds and Wallstreet fair need to brief these companies to zero and make millions. Ten yrs down the street, even though I need to be able to observe a motion picture in a motion picture theatre with my family. In case we all purchase and hold in what we accept, it gives these companies a moment chance. Fair, my 2 cents!                       |91   |
|Once you're done with GME - $AG and $SLV, the gentleman's short squeeze, driven by macro fundamentals|You guys are champs. GME... who would have thought a bunch of crazy retards could reach the front page of the New York Times.  And when you're done with GME, it's time to punish the big banks who have been suppressing the price of silver since the Bear Stearns / JPM merge. It's all in fucking Bloomberg:  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-16/precious-metals-traders-charged-with-rigging-futures-contracts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-16/precious-metals-traders-charged-with-rigging-futures-contracts)  There's an excellent explanation of their scheme here  [https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/palisades-gold-radio/ted-butler-squeezing-out-the-hqxQ5mOdt02/](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/palisades-gold-radio/ted-butler-squeezing-out-the-hqxQ5mOdt02/)  You think GME squeezed hard? Look what happened to silver half a year ago in July:  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/3yssvdm7y1e61.png?width=2588&format=png&auto=webp&s=25d4cfa973d57f1f6083affdcecf6b35e4055a7f  That's one of the banks getting squeezed out of silver, having to cover their shorts... and that's just because rich boomers freaked out about financial instability and finally started calling out the Comex on their bullshit, and taking physically delivery of silver... which they don't have.  Now imagine 4 million degenerates buying $SLV, forcing the trust to take delivery of physical silver from the Comex. This isn't GME, who's fair price is maybe around $5 a share. The FAIR price of silver based on the historical gold/silver ratio is almost surely over $50/ounce. This short squeeze will be a fantastic success even if we can take silver to it's fair market value.  And then there's $AG. Because once silver starts moving, $AG is going to go to the fucking moon. 1) it's a leverage play on silver, 2) It's got it's OWN SHORTS TO BE SQUEEZED OUT. At least a 23% short float as of last count: [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm)  **TL;DR: Once this thing gets going, shares and calls of $SLV and $AG will** ***rocket.***  Edit: **ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€**|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6u9wu/once_youre_done_with_gme_ag_and_slv_the/       |361   |Envision 4 million ruffians buying $SLV, constraining the belief to require conveyance of physical silver from the Comex. This isn't GME, whose reasonable cost is possibly around $5 a share. The Reasonable cost of silver based on the verifiable gold/silver proportion is near, without a doubt over $50/ounce.                                          |89   |
