|[Taxes] Clearing up some misconceptions about capital losses and the "$3k annual limit"                                                                                                                                                    |28   |rm7m1f|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rm7m1f/taxes_clearing_up_some_misconceptions_about/     |22       |1640187167|This topic comes up every year around this time and it really [grinds my gears](https://tenor.com/view/grinds-my-gears-peter-griffin-seth-mc-farlane-family-guy-gif-5207367](https://tenor.com/view/grinds-my-gears-peter-griffin-seth-mc-farlane-family-guy-gif-5207367) the number of people who confidently state incorrect information about this topic. So I am making this post to hopefully clear some things up for some people.  The $3k annual limit applies to the use of capital losses to offset taxes owed on an equal amount of ordinary income (i.e. W-2 income) in that year. But first, capital losses can be used IN THEIR ENTIRETY to offset capital gains from that year. So many people seem to fundamentally misunderstand this concept.  **Example 1:**  So if you have $120,000 in capital gains in 2021 and $30,000 in capital losses, you do not have to spread this capital loss over 10 years $3000 at a time to receive the tax benefit. You can claim the entire $30,000 loss for 2021 taxes, leaving you $90,000 remaining in capital gains for which you will owe taxes.  No capital losses remain to carry forward.  **Example 2:**  If you have $120,000 in capital gains in 2021 and $123,000 in capital losses, you would first use $120,000 of the capital loss to offset the equal amount in capital gains, then the remainder would offset the full $3000 in ordinary income. No capital losses remain to carry forward.  **Example 3:**  If you have $120,000 in capital gains in 2021 and $200,000 in capital losses, you would first use $120,000 of the capital loss to offset the equal amount in capital gains, then an additional $3000 of capital loss would offset up to the limit of $3000 in ordinary income. That would leave $77,000 of capital loss carry-forward for future years.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Further reading:  [https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409)

The crude oil tumbled as well losing 6% midday and closing at 3% in the red.   WSBâ€™s favorite meme stocks were all in red for most of the day continuing the worsening December trend for the meme/growth stocks. GME was up by almost one percent at the close picking up some momentum at the end though well short on the average volume. AMC, despite opening in green following the bumper opening of Spider Man: No way home, reversed mid-morning and finally closed at 2% on the up. Another favorite of the memes, Palantir, plunged by more than 5% to close almost at its 52 week low.  Pandemic favorites Zoom was in green for most of the day and Chegg finished up at less than one percent, as stay at home and lockdowns were being announced in Europe and seems to be increasingly possible in this side of the Atlantic as well.   Carnival Cruise Line (CCL) rose today by 3% after the Company said it expects to be profitable in the second half of 2022 despite rising Omicron cases worldwide.  Moderna shares were briefly up as the Pharma companyâ€™s booster shots provide better protection against Omicron by increasing the antibodies 37-fold. But along with the rest of the market the companyâ€™s shares went down in red and closed 6% down.  Shares of Rocket Companies (Rocket Mortgageâ€™s parent) plunged more than 6% following the acquisition of Finance App TrueBill for $1.28 Bn. This acquisition will help the company to improve upon its image as a FinTech player and not just a mortgage company.

Obviously, this company (being a store typically in malls) had one of the biggest impacts on their sales and overall financials. I think that while it can be a turnaround play due to the valuation, it is important to understand their current financial position and where they may go.   TLDR: I am going to wait a couple of quarters/year to see if this business is truly worth investing in. Currently, I think the business has more downside instead of upside.   **JWN - Nordstrom:**  â€œThe Company was founded in 1901 as a retail shoe business in Seattle, Washington under the guiding principle that success would come by offering customers the very best service, selection, quality, and value. We aspire to be the best fashion retailer in a digitally-connected world by leveraging the strength of the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands. We offer an extensive selection of high-quality brand-name and private-label merchandise focused on apparel, shoes, beauty, accessories, and home goods for women, men, young adults, and children. In order to offer merchandise that our customers want, we purchase from a wide variety of high-quality domestic and foreign suppliers. We also have arrangements with agents and contract manufacturers to produce our private label merchandise. No matter how customers choose to shop, we are committed to delivering superior service, product, and experience, including alterations, order pickup, dining, and styling, to make shopping fun, personalized, and convenient.â€ [2020 10K Filing](https://investor.nordstrom.com/static-files/449f17f6-ffb5-4ec4-8dfe-bf93f16e2822)  Nordstrom operates a higher-end retail fashion store both under Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack where it sells both brand name and private label merchandise. One of the great advantages of having Nordstrom Rack sell at a more affordable price is that they are able to take whatever leftover inventory from the regular Nordstrom stores and finish out their inventory at the Nordstrom Rack. As of Q3 2021, they have three areas that they would like to focus their future opportunities on: â€œimproving Nordstrom Rack performance, increasing profitability and optimizing our supply chain and inventory flow.â€ ([Q3 2021 Filing pg. 17](https://investor.nordstrom.com/static-files/31f1f525-cd5f-42ad-b786-569e5db8bdad)) A big portion of their growth opportunities will come from the Nordstrom Rack adoption rate and utilizing digital transformations to optimize their business. They serve customers at 100 full-line stores and 248 Nordstrom Rack locations in 40 U.S. states and Canada; two clearance stores; and five Nordstrom Local service hubs.  **Nordstrom breaks itself down into the following segments:**  * **Nordstrom**    * This includes Nordstrom.com, TrunkClub.com, Nordstrom-branded U.S. stores, Canada, which includes Nordstrom.ca, Nordstrom Canadian stores, and Nordstrom Rack Canadian stores, and Nordstrom Local * **Nordstrom Rack**    * This includes the NordstromRack.com, Nordstrom Rack-branded U.S. stores, Last Chance clearance stores     https://preview.redd.it/bwgptmw21l681.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=b47bda69acb2734d49bd4443532b4aa8f7de3e64  **Financials:**  * Total Revenue TTM as of Q3 2021: $13.948B     https://preview.redd.it/su0rsqw31l681.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8c47db84d384957b214499d322eaa364b5fae6a  * The profit Margin was floating between \~2% - 3% before the pandemic happened.

Many of the companies are having employee retainment issues on both the corporate and retail sides of the business. Now they did note that social shopping and the surge of social media use allows brands to connect to consumers at a more intimate level. McKinsey recommends that companies should double down on integrating the online shops with users' phones and apps in mind so that they build out data to find what their customers want. Lastly, I would like to point out that over the last year and a half we have had a lot of free money due to stimulus checks and the deferment of student loan payments. This gave many consumers a lot of free money to spend on whatever they may have wanted. While I do think people will still buy at retailersâ€™ stores it is important to watch the consumersâ€™ money supply and how much they have to spend on products. Part of this also comes from looking at the amount of credit the consumers are using..  **Strengths:**  1. Brand Name and reputation -     1. Nordstrom is a very well-known brand in the fashion industry and with the average consumer. This can be seen in their social media growth especially on Instagram. This is really one of the legacy brands in modern fashion so people tend to trust the company and continue to buy both private label and branded products. 2. Digital Growth    1. One of the main points made in their 10Q for Q3 2021 is the need to become more of a data-driven company. They are doing this by implementing more data features within their app and through their online store. This will allow them to pivot faster and continue to deliver products that customers truly want. 3. \~Large Physical footprint in malls or shopping centers    1. Nordstrom is one of the fashion retailers that actually has many physical stores across a lot of malls. While I think this is a strength for those who want to get back to the mall, the higher mall rents and contracts will continue to eat into their bottom line. Also, if a lot of new customers are buying online rather than in stores, this will quickly turn into a huge business liability. So when you are looking at this company make sure to check what their in-store sales are doing and just the overall mall business as a whole for other companies as well. I think that their stores in fashion outlets like Nordstrom rack can provide a better opportunity rather than a full-on shopping mall.  **Risks:**  1. Current Leverage position    1. As mentioned earlier they have a lot of debt on their balance sheet, especially when compared to their small cash size. They could liquidate their inventory to cover this, but if the company reached that point it would be spiraling down anyways. There may come a point where the risk to reward on this may be worth it, but for me personally, the debt combined with the glum outlook makes me want to sit on the sidelines longer to see how the business does over the next year.      https://preview.redd.it/6xqeqjr61l681.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6a4a92caf80f3755d79141f66e063835106c1c2  1. People paying for student loans and not deferring house payments or stimulus checks    1. It is obvious that many have been spending much more over the last year or so and a big component of that is the stimulus checks and student loan deferment. You can see that the chart below shows the spending over the last few quarters ([link](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-spending#:~:text=Consumer%20Spending%20in%20the%20United%20States%20averaged%206075.38%20USD%20Billion,the%20first%20quarter%20of%201950.)). This is definitely something you want to watch especially if there is any recession or reversion back to less consumer credit and overall spending happening. While this is more macro than some of the other points in this article is an important fact to point out because JWN should be firing on all cylinders this year if it benefits from the mass increase in consumer spending. Also, this may push some to buy from the Nordstrom Rack brand rather than the Nordstrom brand.      https://preview.redd.it/7gvusk881l681.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f3e5b7bc2ef931104b6a5970eba350c1b70547e  1. Declining Mall Business    1. This would not be a complete article about a large mall-based store if we did not talk about the decline in mall business overall. An article from pymnts.com pointed out â€œData from Placer.ai show that foot traffic was down 6.5% at indoor malls in September compared to 2019 and down 5.2% at outdoor malls. Thatâ€™s a less steep decline than six months ago when indoor mall foot traffic was down 21% and outdoor was down 8.4%, but itâ€™s a fall nonetheless. In the past six months, only July has seen an increase in mall traffic â€” 1% for indoor shopping centers and 1.8% for outdoorâ€ ([Link](https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2021/mall-sales-are-up-but-shopping-centers-still-have-a-traffic-problem/)). This foot traffic is also hit by the lack of international tourism. This is definitely something you want to watch over the next couple of quarters for a company like Nordstrom.  2. Increased Supply and Labor cost    1. Lastly, inflation will definitely hurt a company like Nordstrom because they are not going to be able to pass every cost onto its consumer. The input costs like shipping and supplies have gone up significantly along with the cost of labor and just turnover in general. The costs from these factors will hurt the bottom line of the company as long as we are in the current environment.   **Discounted Free Cashflow Model**  If you would like to see my worksheet the link is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13M-opbHNhwzZSIY0LMXS_t3LPQXjhHwAEkl2mlKnpXc/edit?usp=sharing).     https://preview.redd.it/6cebcz691l681.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad8385cc9e36cb949ea95b9011ec98cf9fab0906     https://preview.redd.it/f5bntpr91l681.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=16a1fae4b9c3470bdae7bcc4900117dff289f6a5  **Closing Thoughts:**  The valuation may be looking favorable based on the assumption listed in the DCF above, but I do not think the business risks outweigh the valuation currently. From a risk to reward perspective you are hoping they can turn around the business when their enterprise value is nearly double their market cap. I think that the debt along with the capital leases will not allow them to have margin expansion like some of their e-commerce counterparts. If you believe in this turnaround play it could be an opportunity to look into more, but for me personally, I am waiting until I see the turnaround or if the valuation falls to a large margin of safety beyond the current price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Iâ€™m here to tell you why, if you feel want to hold a position for more than a week, you should be throwing your money at Star Bulk Carriers.  Firstly, and less quantitatively, shifting consumer sentiment. Ever since the rona hit in 2020, consumer disposable income has gone away from spending on experiences (i.e., vacations and related expenses, restaurants, etc) and [shifted towards more physical goods.](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-great-consumer-shift-ten-charts-that-show-how-us-shopping-behavior-is-changing) This is only one cause of the supply chain issues that everyone is facing at the moment and is good for all shipping/logistical companies worldwide, but Star Bulk in particular stands to benefit from this more than most due to a [very diverse fleet and projected fleet growth.](https://www.starbulk.com/gr/en/events-presentations/ ) (cited the Sept investor prospectus)  Secondly, theyâ€™re a bit over-leveraged. Now, this might sound like a bad thing at first glance, but itâ€™s not. Donâ€™t think Evergrande types of over-leverage, this has to do with their dividend yield. As of writing this, SBLK has a massive 23+% yield, which, once word gets out, a lot of buy-and-hold dividend portfolios are going to buy in simply for that huge payout. However, I do not believe that that yield can be maintained for the long-term, and SBLK will not become a dividend aristocrat like JNJ. They have an interesting variable dividend policy based on cash flow ([which is very, very positive](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SBLK/financials?p=SBLK) ), and even though the shipping and marine industry will continue to see uptrends in the short- to medium-term, it is, by nature, a volatile industry and this will play into why that yield will eventually be slashed. That all being said, even with a dividend cut, SBLK will only cut dividends based on cash flow which means that as long as cash flow stays positive (which it is projected to, more on that in a bit), SBLK will continue to tick upward with less dividend safety. Because of this, I believe if you do decide you want to go long SBLK, LEAPS are the play.  Thirdly, the exit plan. As things â€œreturn to normalâ€, so is SBLKâ€™s [revenue and cash flow](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sblk/earnings) projected to normalize (but stay positive) by 2023, which is a lot of time to get in and out. Currently, SBLK has found support around the $19-$20 level, and seems to have held there after the run up over the past year.  In conclusion, this may not be a 10-bagger, but with LEAPS as the investment source, a 2- or 3- bagger isnâ€™t unrealistic. (I personally saw 100% gains a week ago before the whole market took a huge shit and didnâ€™t sell)

Concerns that a rise in both producer and consumer prices will put pressure on the Fed to act more aggressively soured sentiment. While officials have not indicated a rush to tighten policy, an abrupt shift is viewed as the most significant downside risk for equities in 2022, according to an informal major newswire survey of fund managers. * Treasury two-year yields surpassed 0.65%, while the US dollar extended its gains for a second day.  Oil and gold have retreated. * A Goldman Sachs Group basket of the 50 most-shorted stocks has fallen back into a bear market for the first time since June, netting profits for traders who sell borrowed shares in the hope of repurchasing them at a lower price. The renewed selloff in the market's more speculative areas adds to evidence of a waning appetite for risk as a new variant of the coronavirus spreads and the Fed focuses on fighting inflation. * â€œWe expect the Fed to announce a doubling in the pace of tapering at the December FOMC meeting, bringing the monthly drawdown to $20 billion and $10 billion per month for Treasuries and MBS, respectively. This would conclude the tapering process in March and open up greater optionality for an earlier liftoff,â€ Deutsche Bank economists [wrote](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-reserves-december-policy-decision-what-to-know-this-week-154344711.html).  https://preview.redd.it/adbxdz862m581.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb7a17830684a8760e3ffe4f70a841bf670fbf4d  [ðŸ•µï¸â€â™‚ï¸ I SPY TA - Monday Dec. 13, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/re5mba/i_spy_ta_monday_dec_13_2021/)  # SPY Recap - Dec. 14  ## Price Action  * *Open: 463.09* * *High: 465.74* * *Low: 460.25* * *Close: 463.36* * *Volume: 94,759,506*  https://preview.redd.it/nto1c06a2m581.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b65a11ad8ff5ce877866670c60e38baeb04d6b26  # SPY - Dec. 15 - Analysis  ## Options Data  *Volume totals reflect options traded during the current session (12/14)*  * Put Volume Total: 1,547,234 **(4.61% decrease from yesterday)** * Call Volume Total: 1,652,633 **(11.95% increase from yesterday)** * Put/Call Volume Ratio: 0.94 **(14.55% decrease from yesterday)** * Put Open Interest Total: 12,787,628 **(2.36% increase from yesterday)** * Call Open Interest Total: 6,710,744 **(3.01% increase from yesterday)** * Put/Call Open Interest Ratio: 1.91 **(0.52% decrease from yesterday)**  https://preview.redd.it/pidhitxb2m581.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=57c339281c88fc7034395a63288541ac852d52de  Date: 12/15  IV: 17.27  DVol: 1.09  Range: 458.40 - 468.48  Key: 465  Crossover: 468  https://preview.redd.it/4ncz0xjd2m581.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=24ceb3a57a1113dca2c6af803d289a3a2c8b8fb7  # Technical Analysis - 65 min  https://preview.redd.it/gtcynajf2m581.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c806604bd28f44d028d4439053724c7eac64b4a  # Commentary:  * **Bears partially filled gap from 12/7 and we saw 460!** * **Bulls need to keep it above 458.83 and want to establish support at 465.13** * **Bears left a gap 467.28 - 466.29 and could act as resistance (highlighted in gap analysis chart)** * **FOMC (12/15) is followed by a very large 12/17 OPEX.

|FED Will Hike Rates In July, A 2nd Time In November, And A Third In Jan 2023. Here Is How I Know                                                                                                                                           |310  |rfy1y4|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rfy1y4/fed_will_hike_rates_in_july_a_2nd_time_in/       |163      |1639452614|For those of you that don't know, there is a way to calculate the probability of the FED raising their benchmark rate and what time they plan to do so as implied by market participants. Here is the PDF in case any of you want some reading material [link](https://www.economics-finance.org/jefe/fin/KeaslerGoffpaper.pdf).   To give you all a brief summary, the equation to calculate the probability is this:   (Effective federal fund implied by future contracts - Current federal fund rate) / (Federal fund rate assuming rate hike - Current federal fund rate)  Effective federal fund implied by future contracts = 100 - current future price  Current federal fund rate and fund rate assuming a hike is the midpoint of the current fed range and the midpoint of the fed range assuming a rate hike. So if the current range is 0 - 0.25%, then the current federal fund rate is 0.125%.   You can find where I got my numbers from here:   [link](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/stirs/30-day-federal-fund.quotes.html)  **May 2022**    (0.24 â€“ 0.125) / (0.375 â€“ 0.125)  = 46%  **July 2022**  (0.355 â€“ 0.125) / (0.375 â€“ 0.125)  = 92%  \*\**This means a 0.25% rate hike is guaranteed by July.*   **August 2022**  (0.42 â€“ 0.375) / (0.625 â€“ 0.375)  =18% \*\* *2nd rate hike unlikely to happen in august*    **October 2022**  (0.53 â€“ 0.375) / (0.625 â€“ 0.375)  =62% \*\* *over 60% chance a second rate hike is coming fall of 2022*  **November 2022**  (0.595 â€“ 0.375) / (0.625 â€“ 0.375)  =88% \*\* *Second rate hike is almost guaranteed to happen by November*  **January 2023**  (0.74 â€“ 0.625) / (0.75 â€“ 0.625)  0.92 \*\* *Third rate hike is guaranteed by January of 2023*  &#x200B;  **Tl;Dr:** Market priced in at least 2 rate hikes in 2022. One in early summer and another by late fall with the chance (albiet a small one) of a third hike in 2022. The third January 2023 rate hike is guaranteed. This means market already priced in interest rate increases and a slowdown in QE. Whatever Powell says on Wednesday is highly unlikely to impact the stock market in any material way because a more hawkish FED is expected.

Brief intro about myself: I'm a retard like you all, but when I don't waste hours [making video memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r8eboq/brief_recap_of_todays_market_action/), I sometimes write [killer DD on shitcos](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q7i6ot/hudson_bay_capital_hedge_fund_pulling_off_a_scam/), with extra focus on hedge fund managed scams. If you were smart enough to figure out the company (couldn't post the name of the company due to the 1.5B$ market cap rule - solution in the comments), you could have shorted or bought put at virtually any strike/expiration and made some honest money.  For the next one, fortunately, the ticker has been pumped enough to cross the WSB threshold! As I write this, the company is trading at a market cap north of 2B$. In case you missed the title, today's shitco is:  # $LWLG  The company has been around since 1991, public since 2006, and named Lightwave Logic since 2008. For what they claim, the company focuses on the "development of photonic devices" or whatever else. But let's dig a little bit deeper into their business.  Throughout this DD, I'll include info I found myself, as well as some from the SA report of:  \- Gold Panda (GP): Lightwave Logic Looks Overvalued Based On Fundamentals  \- White Diamond Research (WDR): Lightwave Logic Is A Tiny, Glorified Science Lab, Recent 500%+ Runup Is Without Substance  I can't link them due to Reddit rules, but I recommend you have a look especially at WDR, excellent work on what a trash company this is.  **So, you may ask, what does this company sell?**  Their revenue is consistently zero. This has been the case for at least 10 years (thanks WDR). If anyone has the patience, you're welcome to look for more zeroes in the past. 11 years ago, someone posted a junk article on SA, claiming:  >For the last 7 years or so a small company named Lightwave Logic (LWLG) has been developing a new electro optical polymer material (EO polymer) that promises increased life for Mooreâ€™s Law.  So, they started developing this stuff 18 years ago, and still have to sell anything. This is getting comical, to the point that of their 70+ patents and applications, some are [so old they'll soon expire](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=lightwave+logic&oq=lightwave+logic&sort=old).  [Cumulative sales of LWLG's core product](https://preview.redd.it/uplh6n88wc581.png?width=1830&format=png&auto=webp&s=32f56b2520869d69792dcb0fc1d4bf2acd5bb1cb)  Their main product are shares. They [sell millions of them every year](https://ycharts.com/companies/LWLG/shares_outstanding) to their customers/bagholders, who are in turn rewarded with a [constant flow of PRs](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LWLG?p=LWLG) talking about the next investor conferences, their latest "breakthrough" or some award at random events they are attending.  **Ok, but how did they do a +2,000% YTD?**  There must be something behind such a rally, right? Not really, except stock promotion. This appears to be happening with the blessing of $LWLG itself, as it all started with them [casually showing logos of companies](https://youtu.be/rcY5vhsWHKo?t=381) to which they "planned to sell components" mid-this year. These included the likes of $CSCO, Huawei, $NOK, and why not let's also throw in the logos of $AMZN, $GOOG and $VZ.  [A few companies that have no interest in LWLG's products](https://preview.redd.it/vanascdbwc581.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=03c8797288e4b261c19fff59d8c123d24e3f1b07)  You can probably tell from $LWLG revenue how much interest there is from these companies to buy their products.  Fun stuff, looking at the YouTube account that posted this (likely an employee), I found [this gem in a March 2017 presentation](https://youtu.be/U60ijsAC70s?t=662).  >The market is ready for our solution: it's scalable...and we have great timing   >   >Our technology platform is exactly what customers are looking for...  This was happening 4 and a half years ago. Great timing.  The stock has undergone a promotion campaign by [https://insiderfinancial.com/](https://insiderfinancial.com/) (through its website, twitter and youtube), which is famous for promoting OTC stock scams. A penny stock boiler room basically.  **What's the thing with the hedge fund?**  There's this hedge fund called [Lincoln Park Capital](https://www.lpcfunds.com/). According to them, they are a:  >Chicago-based *Investment* Group and Asset Management Firm focused on opportunistic investing in public and private companies  Not so surprisingly, one of the first suggestions when typing it on google is "Lincoln Park Capital pump and dump". Their main business is signing agreements to purchase shares from shitcos, and then dumping them on retail bagholders. [Utopia Capital Research](https://utopiacap.com/lincoln-park-capital/?amp) took some time to go through a series of their pump and dumps, pointing out that such stocks have horrific yearly returns of -42%.  (side note: considering going short the whole LPC scam portfolio)  Fortunately, we don't need to worry about $LWLG finances:  [The intern preparing these slides forgot they shouldn't mention it](https://preview.redd.it/p1kkqrffwc581.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2bafd6485f127362c620cc785be839ce2bc4b61)  Their [previous pump and dump agreement](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2019/01/22/1703512/0/en/Lightwave-Logic-Inc-Secures-25MM-Common-Stock-Purchase-Agreement-with-Longstanding-Investor-Lincoln-Park-Capital-Fund-LLC.html) was for 25M$. [The latest one](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lightwave-logic-announces-33-0-million-financing-agreement-with-lincoln-park-capital-fund-301395039.html) came in on Oct. 7th. Following a few weeks of nothing, the stock price has suddenly started flying on no news. This is somewhat unusual, as LPC has the right to purchase shares at $9.16 (we are north of $18 now). Such agreements are typically very bearish, since they put the market buyer in a position of disadvantage. Wash sales? Stock promotion? I don't know.  But who knows, maybe LPC is genuinely investing in $LWLG, holding shares for the long run? That would fit well with their mission, as stated in their website:  >long-term, win-win relationships where Lincoln Park incentives are aligned with the best interests of common shareholders  Well, as you may have guessed, no chance on earth. A look at the [ownership structure as of Sep. 29th](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LWLG/holders?p=LWLG) reveals as much as 1.45% of the shares are held by institutions. LPC doesn't appear to be in the top 10, meaning they own less than 37k shares. I can see your shocked face expression.  It's also interesting to note that insiders appear to own 0.74% of the shares outstanding. Talk about having skin in the game.  Can it get worse? Of course! $LWLG recently got into bed with H.C. Wainwright. This is another shit company that pumps junk stocks and then hits them with a share offering. Also, they're a larger player than LPC, and when they dump shares, they dump like there's no fucking tomorrow. I've previously fallen for some recommended by their analysts (Azurx biopharma and Eyegate pharmaceuticals, both renamed into other shit this year), which promptly turned out to be trash and were hit with an offering. In this case as well, a google search can help confirming HCW's great reputation for scams.  [$LWLG recently went to one of their scam conferences](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-present-h-c-014800849.html). Wouldn't be surprised if an offering is coming in the next few months.  **Sounds like a solid investment so far, anything else?**  The management is either retarded or lying to shareholders. They state in their [most recent corporate update](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-provides-third-quarter-133100829.html):  >As of November 15, 2021, the Company's cash and cash equivalents are approximately $15 million, enabling it to finance operations through March 2023.  For the last two quarters, cash burn was north of 4M$. At the current rate, their reserves should run to zero some time between June and September 2022.  **Why should I buy puts now?**  There's an event hosted by Oppenheimer tomorrow, at which [$LWLG will give a presentation starting at 10:45](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-present-december-investor-133100984.html). Some dumbfucks on Twitter/stocktwits ([here just an example](https://twitter.com/atlsutiger/status/1468931900630880257)) believe they will announce a foundry partnership. It would sound somewhat improbable to me, considering they have participated in hundreds of these conferences, and consistently announced zero such things.  If the run-up is caused by retail investors interest, this may come crashing once the presentation turns out to be the usual nothing burger. If it's just wash sales, LPC could rugpull.  If you feel adventurous enough to bet on the presentation, based on all the shit you've read so far, there's puts for Dec. 17th (this Friday), which should well satisfy your gambling desires. If you typically hang out on r/investing, but somehow ended up today here on WSB, there's some for June 17th, 2022. By then, they would likely have started dumping shares.  **IMPORTANT UPDATE: HUGE VOLUME IN DEC 17 17.5-20 PUTS**  Had the brilliant idea of checking out the options volume for basically all the puts in existence. Turns out on Dec. 8th somebody purchased in a single order [\~500x 17.5 puts](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/LWLG211217P00017500#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) (premium: 1.1-1.3), and [\~900x 20.0 puts](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/LWLG211217P00020000#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) (premium: 2.45).

Also interesting, the orders are typically executed around 2pm, both days.  We are talking about a total of \~350k$ in put options expiring in a week, which is not something one would throw in the wind for the fuck of it. This could be an indicator of an upcoming short report. Last time I've seen the exact same thing happening, it was with another shitco called Moxian (now below WSB threshold). Premium spent in puts was also in the 100ks order. Tried to check the usual suspects (Hindenburg, Muddy Waters and Scorpion Capital but haven't seen much hints.  And yeah, I wish that was me, but I doubt IBKR would be happy giving me 10x leverage on 1 week options.  **Can I somehow get fucked?**  Of course! And you likely will! Timing the market is notoriously impossible. All these elaborate hypotheses could be invalidated if $LWLG announces a revenue-generating partnership, LPC decides starting tomorrow they'll hold all the shares they're buying, or whatever else.  Not financial advice and all the usual crap. Hasta la vista and see you in valhalla.  *Position: nothing but puts, with expirations Dec.-June and strike 10-17.5.*  tl;dr : fuck $LWLG and Lincoln Park Capital|

This is the institutions flat out admitting they will change the rules to bail out the rich but if it happens to us, we get a â€œwell shucks you should have known investing is risky! have you tried cutting out avocados and coffee, maybe doing Uber on the side?â€  We may have collectively driven up enough sentiment in wall street to make other big players go long on GME with us (we do not have the money to move the stock as much as it did alone). we didnâ€™t hurt wall street as a whole, just a few funds went down while others went up and profited off the shorts the same as us. The media wants to pin the blame on us.  It should be crystal clear that this is a rigged game by now. Its time to build new exchanges that canâ€™t arbitrarily change the rules on us. Cr\*\*o has some version of these, maybe they can be repurposed to be trade stock without government intervention. I donâ€™t know exactly what it will look like yet, but the broad next steps i see are - 1. exit the current financial system 2. build a new one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6uhhn/exit_the_system/                               |242   |NASDAQ was shut for a while by the CEO to help investors by allowing more time to change their positions.

|SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE                                                          |Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.  It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.  DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.  It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

I would play by the rules and someone else would ignore them. When they would win I would appeal to the first authority for an explanation. "Are you going to let them get away with this"? "Life isn't fair". No, it is not. The game is the game. Always.  In this moment, the fascade cracks further. When the first breach was made I do not know, perhaps it was Socrates, but today I see thousands. Millions.   Once they were laughing, luxuries falling out of their disgusting diseased mouths as they cackled. The unmistakable stench of derision carried on their breath. They told anyone outside of their elite class that we were fools for even trying. They told us that we were naive. We needed networks to be successful. We needed polish. We needed expertise. We needed THEM. The game is the game. Always.   They are no longer laughing. Their odious oeuvre still wafts through the air. While the rot, and hate, and condescention, remains, the noxious air betrays a new addition. Something all together disconcerting. What it betrays, is fear. They are afraid. And they should be. We do not need their inherited resources masked as acumen. A new day dawns. The day where we make an ever so slight step towards what they fear the most. An even field. Life becoming ever so slighty more fair.   AND. THEY. ARE. SCARED. They look at us and see roughness. We look at them and see softness. We are both correct in our estimation.  The game is the game. Always.  Fuck them in the street. Fuck them all in the street. We are the righteous. We are blessed by Phoebe. What started here will echo through time in the eons to come. Mount up and ride with the fury of a thousand rockets into the universal filament. May the wind always be at your back and the sun upon your face.

|We need to keep this movement going, we all can make history!                                        | I believe right now is one of those rare opportunities that we all can help and do good. Some of these companies like GME, AMC are good companies that's been hit hard by this pandemic. Hedgefunds and Wallstreet just want to short these companies to zero and make millions.    I really think right now we have enough support and enough of us to change that direction in history. Wallstreet says  well weak companies need to just go. 10 yrs down the road though I want to be able to watch a movie in a movie theater with my family. If we all buy and hold in what we believe in it gives these companies a second chance and we as a group can stop these companies from being shorted to death and just disappear. Just my 2 cents!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6uao1/we_need_to_keep_this_movement_going_we_all_can/|139   |Hedge funds and Wallstreet fair need to brief these companies to zero and make millions.

|Once you're done with GME - $AG and $SLV, the gentleman's short squeeze, driven by macro fundamentals|You guys are champs. GME... who would have thought a bunch of crazy retards could reach the front page of the New York Times.  And when you're done with GME, it's time to punish the big banks who have been suppressing the price of silver since the Bear Stearns / JPM merge. It's all in fucking Bloomberg:  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-16/precious-metals-traders-charged-with-rigging-futures-contracts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-16/precious-metals-traders-charged-with-rigging-futures-contracts)  There's an excellent explanation of their scheme here  [https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/palisades-gold-radio/ted-butler-squeezing-out-the-hqxQ5mOdt02/](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/palisades-gold-radio/ted-butler-squeezing-out-the-hqxQ5mOdt02/)  You think GME squeezed hard? Look what happened to silver half a year ago in July:  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/3yssvdm7y1e61.png?width=2588&format=png&auto=webp&s=25d4cfa973d57f1f6083affdcecf6b35e4055a7f  That's one of the banks getting squeezed out of silver, having to cover their shorts... and that's just because rich boomers freaked out about financial instability and finally started calling out the Comex on their bullshit, and taking physically delivery of silver... which they don't have.  Now imagine 4 million degenerates buying $SLV, forcing the trust to take delivery of physical silver from the Comex. This isn't GME, who's fair price is maybe around $5 a share. The FAIR price of silver based on the historical gold/silver ratio is almost surely over $50/ounce. This short squeeze will be a fantastic success even if we can take silver to it's fair market value.  And then there's $AG. Because once silver starts moving, $AG is going to go to the fucking moon. 1) it's a leverage play on silver, 2) It's got it's OWN SHORTS TO BE SQUEEZED OUT. At least a 23% short float as of last count: [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm)  **TL;DR: Once this thing gets going, shares and calls of $SLV and $AG will** ***rocket.***  Edit: **ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€**|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6u9wu/once_youre_done_with_gme_ag_and_slv_the/       |361   |Envision 4 million ruffians buying $SLV, constraining the belief to require conveyance of physical silver from the Comex.

That was a lot of money to me then, still is to be honest, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a hell of a time and learn a lot of valuable information in losing that couple thousand dollars. I still remember how happy I was when i logged in one day to see i had finally earned a flair in my favorite subreddit as well.

If I wouldn't close them at todays market open, they'd do it, and they'd do it for all customers with GME options expiring this friday.

Therefore my calls would get exercised with my balance in the negative.  &#x200B;  Now, I'm fine with closing the position and rolling it out to next week and a higher strike, since I also have a ton of shares.

My college had been taken care of beforehand, because I'd been accepted into a program at UMass Boston for high school students with above-average grades.  A week after graduating high school I received a degree in psychology and went off to be a Marine.  I remember 2008.  I remember my father's savings being nuked, his portfolio going to zero.  Twenty years in the United States Navy and he'd had his savings completely obliterated because of the collapse that Wall Street caused.  I remember my mother calling me in the middle of the night--I was in Okinawa, Japan at the time--and crying because the savings were gone.  That day I started sending a measly $1,000 a month to my family to take care of bills and keep my siblings fed.  My grandmother's retirement was gone in the blink of an eye but she survived, because she loved her job (she was still working in her 60s at a retirement home).  But she had to get a reverse mortgage to keep the house.  I didn't have to send money too long--only about five months--until my father got a better job, and my mother was able to get her own job as well.  But I remember the desperation in her voice.  I'm 34 now.  I've done my time in the military.  No pension, I didn't serve long enough.  But now I can look at this entire debacle and fucking laugh.  I'm a capitalist at heart.  I support being paid for your services.  But I remember the bullshit you engaged in, and I know many others do as well.  Occupy Wall Street did fuck all to you.  But now the internet has given way to arguably the worst thing for you: actual communication and planning.  Now you're seeing what a group of people who loathe everything you stand for can do to you in days.  You won't learn from it, though, which is okay.  This may not keep happening, but every time you decide to attempt something like this the fear will be there, in the back of your mind.  I wish I could have gotten in on this.  I'm not able to spend money like many of these people can.  But I hope it hurts, and it seems like it is.  And there should be no mercy in a situation like this.  Hound them until they concede.

And itâ€™s all fun and games because everyone on the inside wins. How stupid is it that there is no transparency to the underpinnings of valuation and that there is 0 regulation of shorting a company and fucking itâ€™s employees beyond 100% float just to control the asset?  When the dust settles be aware there is a massively growing system that does exists which does not allow this that is called decentralized finance. Worth learning about the future early   Edit: I donâ€™t know for sure but I predict The GME situation ends when the government prints the $ to give to Melvin and friends bc this is an inflationary system and thatâ€™s what happens. Theyâ€™ll be upset they didnt just print the $ earlier. The De-FI space is backed by deflationary systems and itâ€™s worth understanding why thatâ€™s so profoundly different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6tauf/there_is_an_alternative_to_this_system/        |245   |It is stupid that retail gets no chance to participate in any stage of the IPO.
